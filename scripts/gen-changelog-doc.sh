# Generate docs/product/changelog.md from the root CHANGELOG.md.
#
# The root CHANGELOG.md is the single source of truth. This script
# projects it into the shared docs pipeline (manifest.json +
# docs-imports.ts) so the changelog renders on BOTH the marketing site
# (/docs/changelog) and the in-product docs viewer (/_/docs/changelog),
# using the same renderer/styling as every other doc.
#
# What it does:
#   - Replaces the `# Changelog` title with a docs-friendly title + a
#     one-line intro (the first `# heading` becomes the page title in
#     both surfaces).
#   - Drops the `## Unreleased` section (nothing to show users yet).
#   - Stamps a "generated — do not edit" banner so nobody hand-edits the
#     bundled copy.
#
# Run it whenever CHANGELOG.md changes. CI (--check) fails if the
# committed docs copy is stale, keeping the two in lockstep without a
# symlink (which the docs-registry check rejects).
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/gen-changelog-doc.sh            # write docs/product/changelog.md
#   scripts/gen-changelog-doc.sh --check    # fail if it would change

# Changelog

Every released version of DeltaGlider Proxy, newest first. Versions
follow [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/); the Docker image
\`beshultd/deltaglider_proxy:<version>\` is published for each tag.

HEADER

  # Emit version sections from the first "## v" heading to EOF, but DROP
  # any version that has no changeset (an empty `## vX.Y.Z` header with
  # nothing but blank lines before the next `##`). This skips placeholder
  # headers (e.g. a freshly-cut tag whose notes weren't filled in) on the
  # rendered page while leaving CHANGELOG.md itself untouched. Buffer each
  # `## v` block, print it only once we've seen real content.
