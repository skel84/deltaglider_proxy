# Changelog

## Unreleased

### Fixed

- **Batch uploads under one presigned POST signature no longer 403.** A
  presigned browser/CI form-POST policy with `starts-with $key` is designed to
  upload many files under a single signature (e.g. a release's `.zip` +
  `.sha512` + `.sha1`). The replay guard treated the second and later files as a
  replay attack and intermittently returned `403 SignatureDoesNotMatch` — after
  the body had fully uploaded — whenever two files were signed in the same
  second. The guard now keys on the signature **and** the file fingerprint, so a
  batch of distinct files passes while an exact resend stays an idempotent
  overwrite. The policy's own conditions (`starts-with $key`,
  `content-length-range`, `expiration`) remain enforced on every request and are
  the real bound on what a captured signature can write.

### Added

- **Streaming delta compression for unbounded object sizes (opt-in, dormant by
  default).** New code paths reconstruct (GET) and encode (PUT/POST/copy) delta
  objects through bounded-memory spool files instead of buffering the whole
  object in RAM — so delta dedup can scale past the previous in-memory ceiling.
  This is **off by default**: `DGP_SPOOL_THRESHOLD_BYTES` defaults to
  `max_object_size`, so the streaming paths are unreachable until an operator
  lowers the threshold. New tunables: `DGP_SPOOL_DIR`, `DGP_SPOOL_MAX_BYTES`,
  `DGP_SPOOL_THRESHOLD_BYTES`, `DGP_SPOOL_ACQUIRE_TIMEOUT_SECS`,
  `DGP_CODEC_STALL_SECS`, `DGP_CODEC_ABSOLUTE_SECS`. The xdelta3 codec gained a
  stall-based watchdog and streaming entry points; the storage backends gained
  `get_reference_to_file` / `put_reference_from_file` (filesystem hardlinks, S3
  streams). See `docs/plan/streaming-delta-any-size.md`.

## v1.6.0 — 2026-06-27

### Added

- **Instant per-bucket size — no more O(n) listing sweeps.** S3 has no
  protocol call for "how big is this bucket?" — the only primitive is an
  O(n) `ListObjectsV2` sweep, and the old stats scan capped out at 1000
  objects per bucket (slow, and simply wrong for large buckets). The proxy
  now keeps a running per-bucket counter (object count + logical pre-delta
  bytes + stored bytes), updated on every write and delete, the way Ceph or
  Backblaze B2 surface an instant number. `/_/stats` reads it in O(1) — the
  1000-object cap and `truncated` flag are gone — and a **bucket size chip**
  in the browser top bar shows size · object count at a glance (admin
  session only). The counter is per-instance and best-effort (it never
  blocks or fails an S3 request); a **Refresh** button runs an uncapped full
  reconciling scan on demand. `GET /_/api/admin/usage/bucket/:bucket` exposes
  the O(1) read; `POST /_/api/admin/usage/refresh` triggers the reconcile.

- **Save-time config advisories.** The admin Apply dialog (and `config lint`)
  now surface cross-field "this combination is suspicious" warnings *before*
  you save, instead of leaving you to discover the misconfiguration in
  production. Seed rules catch a rate limit running with proxy-header trust
  disabled (which collapses every client onto the proxy's own IP and one
  shared rate-limit bucket), a stale `${username}` IAM permission template
  that silently denies access, a frozen bucket quota, and a public-prefix
  rule that is redundant when auth is already open.

- **In-GUI operational logs — live tail + filter, no SSH required.** A new
  **System logs** view in the admin UI tails the proxy's operational log
  stream live (server-sent events) with a Follow toggle, and filters a
  bounded in-memory backlog by level, target, and free-text search — so
  diagnosing an incident no longer means SSH-ing in to grep stdout. Backed
  by `GET /_/api/admin/logs` (filtered backlog) and
  `GET /_/api/admin/logs/stream` (live SSE), both admin-session-gated. The
  ring is per-instance and in-memory (size via `DGP_LOG_RING_SIZE`, default
  2000; floor via `DGP_LOG_RING_LEVEL`, default INFO) — it supplements, and
  does not replace, shipping the full stdout stream to your log aggregator.

- **`DGP_LOG_FORMAT=json` structured logs.** Opt-in JSON log output so prod
  logs are field-greppable with `jq` (e.g. by client IP, bucket, or action)
  instead of being parsed out of free-text lines.

### Changed

- **Slimmer admin sidebar.** The settings sidebar was consolidated from
  eight groups down to five — single- and two-leaf groups that cost more in
  headers than they earned are folded together (Dashboard, Trace, Delta
  efficiency, Audit log, and System logs now sit under one **Observability**
  group; the single Jobs screen moves under Storage). Every page URL is
  unchanged.

- **More readable audit & auth logs.** Audit lines now resolve the client IP
  the same proxy-aware way the rate limiter does (no more `ip=unknown`
  splitting one client across two values), and brute-force / lockout log
  lines now include the rate-limit bucket key and proxy-trust state — the
  fields that make "all clients collapsed onto one bucket" obvious at a
  glance.

### Fixed

- **Delta uploads work on newer xdelta3 builds (3.1+).** A newer xdelta3
  enables stream "armor" by default, which requires a seekable target the
  proxy doesn't provide when piping — making every delta-eligible `PUT`
  fail with `armor requires a seekable target` on those builds. The codec
  now probes its xdelta3 at startup and disables armor when supported,
  while staying compatible with the older 3.0.x builds that lack the flag.
  Deltas remain format-identical across versions (plain RFC-3284 VCDIFF), so
  a delta encoded on one xdelta3 version still decodes on any other. The
  exact xdelta3 version and armor state are now logged at boot.

## v1.5.4 — 2026-06-27

### Changed

- **Jobs UI polish.** Run/failure tables now show relative times ("3h ago")
  with the full timestamp on hover. The Runs table replaces the
  scanned/copied/skipped/errors number columns with a single proportional
  progress bar (green = copied, red = errors, blank = skipped/already-in-sync;
  the copied count is overlaid, full breakdown on hover) and a clock icon for
  scheduler-triggered runs — freeing horizontal space. Resuming or running a
  rule now immediately refreshes its runs + failures tables so the new run
  shows without reopening the drawer.

### Fixed

- **Clearer "scanned vs processed" reporting.** A run showing `scanned=600,
  processed=0` previously hid the skipped count, making it look stalled when in
  fact all 600 objects were already in sync (nothing to copy). The skipped
  count is now surfaced (in the progress bar + on hover), so an incremental
  run's "nothing to do" outcome is transparent.

## v1.5.3 — 2026-06-26

### Added

- **Delta-passthrough replication fast path.** Replicating a delta-compressed
  object between two compressed buckets no longer reconstructs the full object,
  ships it whole, and re-compresses it at the destination. When the destination
  already holds the byte-identical reference baseline (or has none yet — it's
  seeded), the `.delta` blob is shipped **verbatim**: no xdelta3 on either end,
  and only the delta's bytes cross the wire instead of the full logical object.
  For versioned-artifact mirrors this is a large egress + CPU saving. The fast
  path is gated hard for correctness — it only fires when the destination
  reference's checksum matches and both sides are plaintext, and always falls
  back to the proven reconstruct path otherwise. Each run reports how many
  objects took the fast path and the egress bytes saved (a
  `deltaglider_replication_delta_passthrough_bytes_saved_total` metric).

## v1.5.2 — 2026-06-26

### Fixed

- **Reject malformed `//` keys at ingest.** The proxy is the S3 gateway, but it
  used to store a client's path-join bug verbatim — keys with an empty path
  segment (`a//b`, distinct from `a/b` in S3). Now `PUT`, browser `POST`
  form-upload, and multipart uploads all refuse internal `//` keys. Reads and
  deletes stay permissive so any pre-existing `//` objects remain reachable for
  cleanup; a single trailing `/` (folder marker / listing prefix) is unaffected.

- **Parity Verify survives transient listing throttle.** A parity audit over a
  large bucket lists both sides page-by-page; a single Hetzner `503 SlowDown`
  mid-scan used to fail the whole verify. The page-list now retries transient
  throttle errors with backoff, so a momentary 503 no longer aborts the audit.

- **Live job Runs tab.** A running job's Runs tab now updates its
  scanned/processed counters live, sourced from the jobs-list poll (no second
  poller) — and refetches run history once when the run finishes.

## v1.5.1 — 2026-06-26

### Added

- **Replication parity audit — "is my mirror verified identical?"** A new
  **Verify** tab on each replication job runs an on-demand source↔destination
  parity check and returns an explicit verdict instead of inferring sync from
  `status=succeeded`. It compares logical SHA-256 + size from metadata (no
  downloads — works for delta-stored objects too) and classifies every object
  Match / checksum-mismatch / missing-on-destination / extra-on-destination.
  The green **"Verified in sync"** verdict is the headline; a foreign-object
  three-tier verifier (sha → etag+size → size-only) avoids false alarms on
  objects not written through the proxy.

- **Closed-loop remediation per finding.** Every difference now explains its
  cause, says **policy-awarely** whether re-running the rule will fix it, and
  guides the operator to the right action. Crucially honest: a checksum mismatch
  under a `skip-if-dest-exists` rule is reported as "re-run won't help — overwrite
  manually or change the policy", not a false "just re-run". A persistently
  failing copy surfaces its last error. "Run now" is offered only where it
  actually helps.

### Fixed

- **Replication retries transient source 5xx.** Transient Hetzner-phrased
  throttle/gateway errors (`throttled (status=503)`, `failed (status=502/504)`)
  are now recognised as retryable, so small objects no longer land in the
  failure ring on a momentary source blip — they retry in-line and succeed
  within the same run.

## v1.5.0 — 2026-06-25

### Added

- **Gigantic-file replication: streaming multipart copy with rclone-class
  concurrency.** Replicating a large passthrough object (e.g. a 30 GB backup
  tarball) used to buffer the whole object in memory twice and fail when the
  single monolithic GET dropped mid-stream. The transfer path now streams large
  passthrough objects source→destination via multipart upload with **bounded
  memory** (only `upload_concurrency × part_size` resident, not the whole
  object), **per-part range-resume** (a dropped connection retries just that
  part, not the entire object), and **concurrency** on two axes — parts within
  an object and objects within a run:

  ```yaml
  replication:
    transfers: 4            # objects copied concurrently per run
    upload_concurrency: 4   # multipart parts in flight per object
  ```

  Delta objects still reconstruct transparently; proxy-side AES-encrypted
  backends fall back to the buffered path (native multipart for them is
  deferred). New `max_passthrough_object_size` (default 64 GiB) decouples the
  streaming ceiling from the delta-reconstruction limit.

- **Replication run resilience.** A single slow or poison object can no longer
  kill a whole run. Lease defaults raised (TTL 60s→300s, heartbeat 20s→60s) so a
  multi-minute copy can't lapse the run lease; new `replication.object_timeout`
  (default `30m`) bounds a stalled copy; `replication.object_skip_after_failures`
  (default 5) skips an object that fails N consecutive runs so it stops blocking
  the queue head (stays visible in the job's failures).

- **Replication observability.** New Prometheus metrics expose the streaming
  characteristics for Grafana: `deltaglider_replication_part_bytes_resident`
  (+`_peak`), `_parts_inflight` (+`_peak`), `_objects_inflight` (+`_peak`),
  `_multipart_parts_total`, `_part_retries_total`, `_bytes_streamed_total`.

## v1.4.3 — 2026-06-18

### Added

- **Count-based lifecycle retention (`retain-newest`).** A new lifecycle
  action that keeps the newest N objects in a prefix and deletes the rest
  — selection by *count*, not age — for the canonical "keep the last N
  backups" cleanup that native S3 lifecycle never shipped:

  ```yaml
  action:
    type: retain-newest
    count: 2
    qualify:                   # eligibility filter (NOT a delete guard)
      min_size_bytes: 1048576  #   ignore truncated/empty junk
      min_age: "1h"            #   ignore in-flight uploads
    protect_younger_than: "7d" # optional delete-side guard
  ```

  `qualify` is an eligibility gate — an object failing it is invisible
  (never counted toward N, never deleted) — so an accidental empty or
  half-written file can't anchor the keep set or displace a real backup.
  `protect_younger_than` is a separate delete-side guard (spares an object
  this run, never promotes it into the keep set). "Keep newest N" is
  set-relative, so it runs on a dedicated collect→rank→act worker path;
  the age-based path stays per-object/streaming and unchanged.

- **Savings dashboard reads as a before/after bill.** The metrics hero
  dollar line now tells the bill story directly: the regular monthly bill
  (what you'd pay without DeltaGlider) struck through, the compressed bill
  as the green headline (what you actually pay), and the saving kept quiet
  underneath ($/mo · $/yr). Previously the green headline showed the
  *saved* amount, which read like "what you pay" when it was the opposite.

### Fixed

- **Browser form-POST upload returned 403 on an idempotent retry.** The
  presigned form-POST replay cache was keyed only on the SigV4 signature
  and rejected *any* second request bearing an already-seen signature for
  up to 24h (the policy-expiry-capped TTL). A presigned POST's signature
  is deterministic for a given policy + second-resolution `x-amz-date`, so
  a CI retry or pipeline re-run of the same artifact re-sent the identical
  signed request and got a spurious `403 SignatureDoesNotMatch` (observed
  uploading the deterministic `.sha1` / `.sha512` siblings right after a
  `.zip`). The replay entry now also fingerprints the `(key, body)` the
  signature first wrote: re-sending the **same object** is an idempotent
  retry and is allowed, while reusing a captured signature to write a
  **different key or body** is still blocked (form-POST `key` is
  `starts-with ""`, so one signature could otherwise authorise writing
  anywhere). Replay protection is preserved; legitimate retries succeed.

### Docs & site

- **Documentation site overhaul.** A Warp-style collapsible sidebar tree
  with a calmer editorial type scale and focus-on-current-section
  navigation; clickable heading anchors; a readable search input with a
  correctly-centred Clear button that closes on result selection; the
  `/docs` landing reworked into 3-up feature cards with readable
  descriptors; and an accessibility/readability pass (type scale, code
  panels, link accent, inline-code chip sizing).
- **Accurate, more complete docs content.** Acted on an expert docs-site
  review (search, intro, S3-compatibility, FAQ) and onboarding/
  architecture/versioning gaps; corrected the `authentication: none`
  tutorial; embedded all product-doc screenshots (not a stale subset);
  and replaced the ASCII data-path diagram with a rendered image.
- **Marketing site polish.** Split-bleed hero with an upbeat captioned
  demo video, a lighter page background, and a branded glow on the demo
  video frame.

## v1.4.2 — 2026-06-13

### Added

- **Inline video & audio preview in the object browser.** Double-clicking
  (or the inspector Preview button on) an `mp4` / `webm` / `mov` / `m4v` /
  `ogv` object now plays it in a native `<video>` player, and `mp3` / `wav`
  / `ogg` / `m4a` / `aac` / `flac` / `opus` in an `<audio>` player —
  streamed from a presigned URL so the proxy's range support (`206 Partial
  Content`) handles seeking without buffering through the browser tab. A
  codec the browser can't decode falls back to the existing Download
  affordance. Previously these fell through to "Preview not available".

## v1.4.1 — 2026-06-12

### Removed (breaking)

- **TOML config support removed entirely.** YAML is the only config
  format. Gone: TOML loading (`Config::from_toml_file` / `from_toml_str`
  and the `.toml` boot path), TOML persisting, the `config migrate`
  subcommand, the `--show-toml` flag, the
  `deltaglider_proxy.toml.example` file, and the
  `DGP_SILENCE_TOML_DEPRECATION` env var. A `.toml` config — pointed at
  via `DGP_CONFIG`/`--config` or found on the default search path — now
  fails startup loudly with: "TOML configs are no longer supported
  (removed in v1.4.1). Convert with `deltaglider_proxy config migrate`
  on v1.4.0, then point the server at the YAML file." Upgrade path:
  run `config migrate` on v1.4.0 (the last release that ships it)
  BEFORE upgrading.

### Added

- **`${env:NAME}` references round-trip.** The proxy now records which
  config values were resolved from `${env:...}` references and re-emits
  the references — instead of materialized secrets — when persisting the
  config to disk (GUI changes) and in `GET /config/export`. Redactors
  keep references intact (a reference is not a secret). The admin
  `/config/apply` document path now also expands `${env:NAME}` against
  the server environment. Together these make the IaC loop lossless:
  provision a secret-free template, tweak via the GUI, export, and
  commit the export straight back into IaC.

### Fixed

- **Apply dialog showed "No changes detected" for credential
  rotations.** The section diff redacted secrets on both sides before
  comparing, so rotating a secret access key, encryption key, OAuth
  client secret, or webhook header produced an empty diff. Secrets are
  now projected to deterministic one-way fingerprints (`fp:xxxxxxxx`)
  for the comparison: unchanged secrets compare equal, rotations
  surface as a readable fingerprint swap, and no key material appears
  in the dialog. `${env:NAME}` references stay readable verbatim.

## v1.4.0 — 2026-06-12

### Added

- **One Jobs surface.** Replication rules, lifecycle rules, and one-off
  maintenance jobs (bucket migration, re-encryption) now live on a single
  admin screen backed by a unified API (`GET /jobs`, per-kind
  pause / resume / run-now / preview / cancel, `POST /jobs/reencrypt`,
  `POST /buckets/:bucket/migrate`). The old per-subsystem
  `/replication*`, `/lifecycle*`, `/maintenance*` admin routes are gone.
- **Bucket migration between backends** as a resumable background job
  (stage → copy → verify → flip → cleanup) with a per-bucket write gate:
  writes to a bucket under maintenance get `503 Slow Down`, reads pass.
  Re-encrypt jobs use the same machinery, survive restarts, and never
  resurrect a peer instance's live job after an IAM-DB sync.
- **Redesigned Analytics dashboard.** Percent-led savings hero
  ("270% smaller") with a before/after proof bar, one unified bucket list
  (ratio + footprint per bucket, per-row scan), an "est. $ left on the
  table" panel for compression-off buckets, a scan-coverage strip, and a
  designed empty state. The old gauge / facts-grid / duplicate top-buckets
  panels are gone.
- **App-wide keyboard shortcuts**: ⌘K command palette over the whole admin
  IA, ⌘S apply-current-section, `?` shortcuts help, arrow-key navigation
  in the object browser.
- **Multi-backend bucket management**: create-a-bucket-on-a-named-backend
  admin API + UI, backend origin badges across the browser and admin.
- **Documentation rewritten to Diátaxis** — 3 executed tutorials, 25
  goal-named how-to guides, 13 reference pages, 5 explanations; 14 new
  product screenshots; the marketing site renders the same corpus.
- **Prod-config regression tests**: a sanitized structure-true snapshot of
  the production config validated in the CI gate (parse, declarative-IAM
  reconciler validation, export round-trip) plus a local harness
  (`scripts/test-prod-config.sh`) that boots the current branch against
  the real prod backup with dynamically derived assertions.

### Fixed

- Creating a bucket on a non-default backend could land it on the wrong
  backend on case-mismatched names.
- Lifecycle crash-resume could replay a stale cursor after a same-named
  rule was redefined with a different scope (cursor is now scope-stamped).
- Maintenance requeue-on-boot is lease-aware — a synced config DB carrying
  a peer's live job is no longer resurrected locally.
- Phase machines (migrate / re-encrypt) now fail loudly when a pagination
  page budget truncates a phase instead of silently advancing.
- Admin bulk copy/move/delete now participates in the per-bucket write
  gate instead of bypassing it.
- Jobs table no longer renders job names one character per line in narrow
  columns.

## v1.3.1 — 2026-06-05

## v1.3.0 — 2026-06-05

### Changed (breaking) — IAM permission templates are now `${iam:...}`

- IAM identity templates in `resources` / string condition values are now
  **`${iam:username}` and `${iam:access_key_id}`** (previously bare `${username}`
  / `${access_key_id}`). The `iam:` prefix makes them an explicit namespace,
  symmetric with the new `${env:NAME}` config expansion — every `${ns:name}`
  declares when it resolves (iam = request time, env = load time), and a bare
  `${...}` is now a literal.
- **Breaking:** a bare `${username}` no longer substitutes — it fails policy
  validation (user/group API + declarative apply). Update existing policies to
  the `${iam:...}` form. No back-compat shim.

### Added — in-process `${env:...}` config expansion

- **Config files now expand `${env:NAME}` / `${env:NAME:-default}` against the
  environment when loaded**, removing the need for an external `envsubst` step in
  deployments. Ship a secret-free config with `${env:...}` placeholders and inject
  the values as env vars; an unset reference (with no default) fails loudly at
  load instead of silently leaving a hole.
  - The `env:` prefix is mandatory: it keeps env placeholders distinct from DGP's
    runtime IAM permission templates (`${username}`, `${access_key_id}`,
    `${email}`, `${filename}`), which are left untouched for the auth layer.
  - `$$` is a literal `$` escape (e.g. for a literal `${...}` in a comment).
  - Applies on the disk-load paths — server startup, `config lint`, and
    `config apply` — but NOT `config migrate` (templates are preserved) nor the
    admin API's in-memory doc-apply (no surprise expansion against the server env).

### Added — Slack notifications connector

- **Object events can now post to Slack.** Setting `event_delivery.format = slack`
  renders each outbox event as a Slack message (Block Kit + plain-text fallback)
  instead of the raw `{schema,event}` JSON envelope. Two delivery modes:
  - **Incoming Webhook URL** — point `webhook_url`/`webhook_urls` at a
    `hooks.slack.com` URL. Each URL is bound by Slack to a single channel; the
    cosmetic `slack_username` / `slack_icon_emoji` overrides apply here.
  - **Bot token** (`slack_bot_token`, `xoxb-…`) — delivery uses the Slack Web API
    (`chat.postMessage`), posting to `slack_channel` with support for `@`-mentions
    and any channel via `chat:write.public`.
- **Per-bucket / per-prefix channel routing** (bot-token mode only). When
  `slack_routes` is non-empty, an eligible event posts to EVERY route it matches —
  so different buckets/prefixes can fan out to different channels (and one object
  can hit several). `slack_notify_kinds` (default `["ObjectCreated"]`) plus
  `slack_include_globs` / `slack_exclude_globs` are a global pre-filter for what's
  eligible; routes then pick the channels.
- **Editable from the admin UI** at Configuration → Advanced → Webhook delivery,
  alongside the raw-webhook config. The **bot token is a secret**: it's masked in
  the GUI and in every export, and leaving the masked value untouched preserves
  the real token on save (both the section-PUT and full-document export→apply
  paths), exactly like webhook auth headers.

## v1.2.0 — 2026-06-02

### Added — event-driven replication

- **Replication now reacts to object mutations in near-real time.** Previously
  replication was pure-poll: a timer did a full `list + HEAD` diff every tick,
  scaling with bucket size rather than change rate. Object mutations
  (PUT / DELETE / COPY / CompleteMultipartUpload) are now appended to the durable
  `event_outbox` and drained by a per-process consumer that fans each key out to
  the matching replication rules. The per-rule `interval` is repurposed as a slow
  (default **24h**) full-reconcile safety net — events are the primary trigger.
  - Pub/sub via a per-listener cursor over the append-only outbox: webhook
    delivery and replication keep independent cursors and never contend.
  - Per-key compaction collapses a burst of events for one key into a single
    liveness verdict; idempotency stays in one place (the planner + a dest HEAD),
    shared with reconcile — no new per-key sync table.
  - At-least-once delivery: the cursor advances only to the highest contiguous
    fully-handled event id; reconcile backstops the rest.
  - The webhook pruner clamps its delete floor to the smallest **active** listener
    cursor, so a stuck or disabled consumer can no longer pin the outbox and let
    it grow without bound.

### Added — Webhook delivery GUI

- **Webhook (event-delivery) config is now editable from the admin UI** at
  Configuration → Advanced → Webhook delivery — the last config surface that was
  YAML/env-only. Enable switch, endpoint list, auth-header editor, retry /
  retention / batching tuning, and a live delivery-status strip linking to the
  Event Outbox viewer.
- **Header secrets are masked and preserved.** Header values are shown masked in
  the GUI and in every export; leaving a masked value untouched preserves the
  real token on save (both the section-PUT and the full-document export→apply
  paths), while a removed header is deleted and a renamed-but-not-retyped secret
  is blocked rather than silently dropped.

### Fixed — CI

- **Self-hosted runner "Too many open files".** The CI integration job runs ~35
  test binaries in parallel inside Ryzen LXC runners whose nested dockerd
  defaulted to a 1024 nofile limit; the aggregate fd count overflowed it. Raised
  the limit at the dockerd, workflow (`--ulimit`), and test-harness (seed
  concurrency cap) layers.

## v1.1.2 — 2026-06-02

### Fixed — hardening (from an adversarial Rust audit)

- **Form-POST uploads can no longer OOM the proxy.** The `multipart/form-data`
  POST interceptor buffered the request body with no ceiling
  (`to_bytes(usize::MAX)`); because it ran above `DefaultBodyLimit` — which only
  does an eager `Content-Length` check — a chunked or oversized POST slipped past
  the limit. Now bounded by `max_object_size` (oversized → `413`). This also
  fixes a real upload failure with aws-cli's chunked transfer encoding.
- **CopyObject on a concurrently-deleted source now returns `404`, not `500`.**
  The generic S3 error classifier didn't recognise `NoSuchKey`, so a benign race
  surfaced as an internal error.
- **Form-POST signature length is no longer leaked via timing.** The HMAC compare
  now rejects any signature that isn't exactly 64 hex characters before any
  length-dependent work.

## v1.1.1 — 2026-06-01

### Changed — IAM permission editor

- **One-line grant editor.** Each permission rule is now a single row —
  `WHERE` (bucket / prefix) + `CAN DO` (the five atomic actions as a horizontal
  strip of on/off toggle-chips) + Conditions + Remove. The chips are an
  independent multi-select with a checkbox indicator (solid when on, dashed when
  off), so "write without delete" is expressible; the Admin chip auto-disables
  on prefix-scoped grants (a bucket-level op is meaningless on a sub-prefix), and
  a live plain-language caption summarises each grant. "Clear all" appears inline
  beside the actions when more than one is selected.

### Fixed — IAM permission editor correctness

- **Resource rows no longer drop or re-key on blur.** The on-blur normalizer
  re-split the whole comma-joined resource string, discarding in-progress empty
  rows and reassigning React keys to surviving rows; it now normalizes only the
  blurred row in place.
- **Narrowing a grant's scope no longer silently loses the rule.** Reducing a
  resource from a bucket to a sub-prefix strips the now-invalid `admin` action,
  and any incomplete rule (missing actions or resource) is flagged inline ("…or
  this rule is dropped on save") instead of vanishing on Apply.
- **Invalid resource patterns are caught inline.** Patterns the server rejects
  (a `*` that isn't trailing, embedded whitespace) now show an inline error
  before Apply, instead of an opaque HTTP 400.

## v1.1.0 — 2026-05-31

### Added

- **Full IAM export/import as YAML.** The admin GUI Account menu gains
  "Export full IAM (YAML)" and "Import full IAM (YAML)", round-tripping the
  entire IAM state (users, groups, OAuth/auth providers, group-mapping rules)
  as declarative `access:`-shaped YAML — distinct from the runtime-config YAML,
  which excludes the encrypted IAM DB. Export includes real secrets for a
  lossless round-trip (with a prominent live-credentials warning); import is a
  dry-run change preview → confirm → atomic single-transaction reconcile.
  Backed by new admin endpoints `config/declarative-iam-{export,validate,apply}`
  (mode-agnostic, admin-GUI-session gated).

### Fixed — IAM permission editor (GUI)

- **Bucket-root listing ("" prefix) is now expressible.** The `s3:prefix`
  condition editor round-tripped through a comma-joined string that silently
  dropped the empty-string entry, so "list from the bucket root" could not be
  saved. The editor now uses a string-array contract end-to-end with a
  dedicated "List bucket root (empty prefix)" toggle; the empty string is
  preserved through save and reload.
- **Prefix conditions no longer auto-append a trailing slash on blur.** For an
  `s3:prefix StringLike` condition, `ror/libs` and `ror/libs/` are not
  equivalent (the slash-less form also matches `ror/libs-internal/…`); the blur
  normalizer now preserves the operator's trailing-slash choice.
- **Resource rows keyed by stable ids** (were array-indexed), removing a
  stale-key class of focus/row-confusion bugs when adding or deleting rows.
- **Inline unknown-bucket warning.** A resource pattern targeting a bucket that
  doesn't exist (e.g. `ror/lib/*` when the data is in `beshu/ror/libs/*`)
  silently grants nothing; the rule editor now flags it inline with a
  near-miss suggestion.

### Changed — bucket browser & dashboard

- **URL-routed bucket browser.** Browser navigation (bucket, folder prefix) is
  reflected in the URL, so back/forward, deep-links, and reload now restore the
  exact view instead of resetting to the root.
- **Dashboard scan state survives navigation.** "Scan all buckets" results are
  server-side state the dashboard re-attaches to on mount (including in-flight
  scans), and cached results carry a derived staleness nudge after 6 hours
  rather than silently disappearing when you navigate away and back.

## v1.0.1 — 2026-05-31 — Hardening, cleanup & reliability

A large quality release: the admin UI was hardened against a class of
state-management bugs and then substantially refactored for less code and
cleaner structure; the S3 bucket browser got the same treatment; and several
correctness/reliability gaps were closed across the engine and S3 layer. No
wire-format or breaking changes — drop-in over v1.0.0.

### Fixed — data integrity & correctness

- **Same-location move no longer deletes data.** The server bulk-move handler
  did copy-then-delete-source for every item; a "move" whose destination
  resolved to the same bucket+key as the source was a self-copy no-op, so the
  unconditional source delete destroyed the only copy. A server-side guard
  (`is_same_location_move`) now skips the source delete for any such item,
  regardless of what the client sends.
- **Range-GET out-of-bounds panic** on objects whose stored `file_size`
  metadata exceeded the reconstructed byte length now returns `400 InvalidRange`
  instead of crashing the worker.
- **Doubled-quote ETag** on passthrough HEAD/GET (`""abc""`) fixed to a single
  quoted form; strict S3 clients rejected the doubled form.
- **Admin config editors**: eliminated a class of row-drop / stale-closure /
  lost-edit / index-key bugs (prefix list, permissions, buckets, advanced,
  credentials, auth-rules, setup wizard); a failed Apply no longer discards
  in-flight edits.
- **Bucket browser**: inspector async-race (download/share landing in the wrong
  object), pagination desync on search, bulk-copy not clearing selection,
  destination-prefix join bug, 0-byte upload handling, and a perpetual
  "Loading compression stats…" spinner for passthrough objects.

### Changed — performance & logging

- **LIST `metadata=true` skips the per-object HEAD for passthrough, non-delta
  files** (checksum sidecars, images, …): they're stored verbatim so the LIST
  size is authoritative. Cuts the upstream HEAD burst on build-artifact
  listings (which was also a throttle/500 trigger).
- **Tamed the `PATHOLOGICAL` log flood**: missing DG metadata on a normal
  passthrough file is benign and now logs at DEBUG; the loud WARN is reserved
  for `.delta`/`reference.bin` files where it actually breaks reconstruction.
- **Catch-all 500s now log the upstream cause** before mapping, so production
  500s are debuggable.

### Changed — admin & browser UI refactor (no behavior change)

- Admin UI clean-code + architecture pass: migrated Buckets/Lifecycle/
  Replication onto the shared `useSectionEditor`; extracted `MasterDetailPanel`,
  `RuleListEditor`, and a shared overlay-dropdown primitive; split the four
  largest panels into per-concern files; split `adminApi.ts` into a barrel over
  domain modules; ~1k LOC of duplication removed.
- Bucket-browser clean-code + correctness pass: shared `getFileName` /
  `downloadBlobAsFile` / `pluralize` helpers, `StorageTypeTag` / `FolderSizeCell`
  extraction, s3client pure helpers.

### Added — testing

- Codec encode→reconstruct **round-trip property test** (the core data-integrity
  invariant), a **criterion benchmark harness** for the codec hot paths, and a
  panic-surface audit of the request hot paths. Plus ~15 new Node regression
  scripts covering the extracted pure UI helpers.

## v1.0.0 — 2026-05-22 — Project-shape milestone

v1.0.0 marks the official **single canonical implementation**: one Rust
binary (`deltaglider_proxy`) ships the S3-compatible proxy, the
AWS-CLI-shaped `s3` command group, and the web UI. The Python
[`deltaglider`](https://github.com/beshu-tech/deltaglider) tool is
deprecated as of its parallel v6.2.0 release; PyPI installs continue
to work indefinitely but no further updates will land there. The wire
format remains byte-identical across both tools.

This release also closes the four post-v0.12.0 regression fixes
(`HeadBucket` 501, multipart `x-amz-storage-type` header drop, `s3 ls`
doctest, all from the v0.12.0 axum-handler retirement) plus the
small UX gaps the v1.0.0 plan flagged.

### Changed

- **`s3 migrate` learned `--source-endpoint-url`** for cross-provider
  migrations (e.g. Hetzner → AWS). When unset, behaviour is identical
  to v0.12.0: a single engine handles both sides. When set, builds
  two engines (source + destination); credentials are shared across
  both. Per-side credential flags can land later if operators ask.
- **`s3 cp` / `s3 sync` / `s3 migrate` learned `--max-object-size-mb`**
  to override the engine's per-invocation 100 MiB defensive ceiling
  (memory-safe limit for xdelta3 — reference + delta + result all
  held in RAM simultaneously). Operators uploading large artifacts
  (release ZIPs, disk images) used to hit a "Object too large" error
  with no actionable hint; now there's a flag and the error text
  points at it.

### Fixed

- **s3s: implement `HeadBucket` (`HEAD /<bucket>`).** The v0.12.0
  axum-handler retirement deleted the legacy handler but the s3s
  trait impl never had one of its own — s3s's default returned 501.
  Real AWS / MinIO return `404 NoSuchBucket` when the bucket is
  missing; we now mirror that. Restores
  `error_test::test_nosuchbucket_xml_response` and
  `test_entitytoolarge_response`.
- **s3s multipart: emit `x-amz-storage-type` on
  CompleteMultipartUpload.** The legacy axum handler set this header
  from `store_result.metadata.storage_info.label()`; the s3s impl
  dropped it during the v0.12.0 retirement. Restored to match
  `head_object` / `get_object` / `put_object` parity, fixing
  `test_multipart_delta_compression` and
  `test_multipart_large_zip_forces_passthrough_on_s3_backend`.
- **cli docs: `s3 ls` shell example no longer breaks `cargo test --doc`.**
  The four-space indentation made rustdoc try to compile the example
  as Rust. Wrapped in ```text so it stays prose.
- **Stronger `--max-object-size-mb` error path:** Detect
  `EngineError::TooLarge` in `cp` / `sync` / `migrate` and render an
  actionable message naming both the per-invocation flag and the
  server-side `max_object_size` YAML knob.

### Deprecated (downstream — not in this repo)

- **The Python `deltaglider` package is deprecated as of v6.2.0.**
  Migration: `brew install beshu-tech/tap/deltaglider_proxy` (or
  download the binary), then `alias dg='deltaglider_proxy s3'`. Every
  Python subcommand has a 1:1 Rust equivalent. The Python repo will
  be archived approximately one week after v6.2.0 hits PyPI.

## v0.12.0 — 2026-05-19

### Removed (BREAKING)

- **Legacy axum-handler S3 adapter retired.** The `s3s` crate adapter
  has been the production S3 protocol path for several releases; the
  hand-rolled axum-handler implementation it was meant to replace is
  now deleted (~3500 LOC of `src/api/handlers/{object,bucket,multipart}.rs`
  plus the supporting XML response builders, the parity test suite,
  and `src/api/xml.rs`). With it goes:
    * the `s3s-adapter` Cargo feature flag (now an unconditional dep),
    * the `DGP_S3_ADAPTER` env var (no more selector),
    * the `test-s3s-adapter` CI job and the nightly `test-all-s3s-adapter`
      job (every test they ran is in the regular matrix already),
    * the `x-deltaglider-s3-adapter: s3s` diagnostic response header
      (only useful when both adapters coexisted),
    * `docs/dev/s3-adapter-decision.md` and `docs/plan/s3s-adapter-migration.md`
      (superseded by this release).
  Operators previously rolling back via `DGP_S3_ADAPTER=axum` have no
  fallback path. If a behavior regression turns up, file a bug against
  the s3s adapter directly — there is no longer a second implementation
  to fall back on.

### Changed (BREAKING)

- **CLI client verbs moved under `s3` subgroup.** The 10 AWS-CLI-shaped
  client commands (`cp`, `ls`, `rm`, `sync`, `migrate`, `stats`, `verify`,
  `purge`, `get-bucket-acl`, `put-bucket-acl`) are now nested under
  `deltaglider_proxy s3 <verb>` instead of being top-level. Top-level
  `deltaglider_proxy --help` is now uncluttered, listing only `config`,
  `admission`, and `s3` as subcommand groups; future top-level proxy
  flags (`init`, `set-bootstrap-password`, etc.) no longer collide.
  Migration: replace `deltaglider_proxy cp ...` with `deltaglider_proxy
  s3 cp ...` (likewise for the other nine verbs). Operators preferring
  the Python-style invocation can alias `dg='deltaglider_proxy s3'`.
  Library callers (`deltaglider_proxy::cli::cp::run` etc.) are
  unchanged — only the CLI surface moved.

### Fixed

- **Eliminated `unsafe { std::env::set_var("DGP_BACKEND_ALLOW_LOCAL", ...) }`
  from CLI startup paths.** The SSRF allow-local opt-in now flows
  through the typed `BackendConfig::S3.allow_local` field instead of
  via process-env mutation. The legacy `DGP_BACKEND_ALLOW_LOCAL` env
  var is still honoured (backward-compat for existing deployments and
  the proxy's env-driven config layer), so no operator action is
  required. Eliminates a Rust-2024-`unsafe` block from three CLI
  modules (`engine_factory.rs`, `bucket_acl.rs`, `purge.rs`) and makes
  the engine constructible without mutating process state. New
  `BackendConfig::S3.allow_local` (defaults to `false`, serde-skipped
  when unset for clean YAML diffs) is the preferred path going
  forward; legacy YAMLs parse unchanged. Added regression test
  `build_client_allows_dev_local_when_config_field_set` pinning the
  typed-field path independent of env.

- **CI workflow `DGP_BACKEND_ALLOW_LOCAL=true` job-level env**
  ([2fbcc5c](#) + [577edd7](#) + [e643ba3](#)) — wave-1 security
  (`3ff9edc`) rejected `http://localhost:9000` MinIO endpoints by
  default, breaking the `[ci-integration]`-gated Integration Tests
  batch (hidden on main pushes by the gate). Set the opt-in at job
  level in `ci.yml` and `test-all-nightly.yml`; threaded through
  `interop_test.rs`'s `env_clear()` barrier; updated 4 cli_s3 test
  fixtures that forgot to create the source bucket before seeding.
- **`DGP_REPLAY_WINDOW_SECS=0` in CI** ([577edd7](#)) to disable the
  wave-3 SigV4 replay cache for tests that legitimately re-issue
  identical signed requests inside the 2s window. Production keeps
  the cache on; the two auth tests validating the wave-3 replay
  contract override the env back to `2` via `TestServerBuilder::env`.
- **`DGP_USAGE_CACHE_TTL_SECS` made env-configurable** ([2c5ea89](#))
  so quota tests can shorten the 5-minute scan-cache TTL. Production
  default unchanged. Fixed two deterministic-race test failures in
  `quota_test.rs` where the spawned scan finished BEFORE the seed PUT
  body landed on disk, caching a "0 bytes" stale read for 5 minutes.
- **CI builder image now ships `clang` + `lld`** ([95cdeac](#)) —
  the compile-time-optimization PR added `linker = "clang"` +
  `-fuse-ld=lld` to `.cargo/config.toml` but the GHCR builder image
  only had `gcc`. Cascaded every build-gated job into `error: linker
  'clang' not found`. Two-line `apt-get install` addition plus
  verification step (`clang --version`, `ld.lld --version`).

## v0.11.0 — 2026-05-16

### Added

- **Bucket-wide scan endpoint with persistent on-disk cache**, backing
  the dashboard's headline totals. Replaces the old `/_/stats` path
  that capped at 1,000 objects per scan — useless on any real bucket
  (a 1.4 TB Hetzner bucket with 79k objects reported "1,000+" and
  guessed savings off the first kilobyte). New
  `GET /_/api/admin/diagnostics/scan/status[?bucket=X]` returns the
  cached map (or single bucket); `POST …/scan/start` kicks a
  paginated walk; `POST …/scan/stop` cancels; `DELETE …/scan` forgets
  a cached result; `GET …/scan/stream?bucket=X` opens an SSE feed of
  per-page progress (`objects`, `original_bytes`, `stored_bytes`,
  `pages_done`, `has_more`). Results persist to
  `.deltaglider_scans/<bucket>.json` with a schema-version field —
  results survive proxy restart, no TTL, regenerate on deserialise
  failure. Per-bucket scan handle backed by `tokio::sync::watch` +
  `CancellationToken`; the scan continues to completion even after
  every SSE subscriber disconnects (useful for long PB-scale walks
  left running overnight). 6 unit tests cover persistence, corrupted-
  file recovery, version-mismatch rejection, and bucket-name
  sanitisation against `..` / `/` traversal.

- **"Money shot" Analytics dashboard redesign.** The four flat KPI
  cards (Total storage · Space saved · Savings % · Est. monthly
  savings) collapse into one 12-col `HeroSavingsPanel` showing
  storage saved at billboard scale with a count-up animation on
  first visit per session (`sessionStorage` gate, honours
  `prefers-reduced-motion`), a scale-accurate kept-vs-saved bar
  echoing the hero ratio, a dollar savings line with cost-rate
  preset popover, and a cache-age footer line ("Newest scan 47 s
  ago · Oldest 3 h 12 m ago · 2 buckets excluded"). Single new
  dependency: `motion@^12` for the orchestrated count-up + bar-grow
  animation (~5 KB initial, ~30 KB lazy). Below the hero, the old
  "Storage by bucket" recharts stacked bar — which collapsed to a
  single line when one bucket dwarfed the rest — is replaced by a
  **Bucket fleet** view where every bucket gets a full-width ratio
  bar plus a thin scale-relative footprint bar underneath, so even
  tiny buckets are legible. The dead "Scan progress" + "Compression
  opportunities" panels (empty 90% of the time) become a **By the
  numbers** insights grid (largest bucket / biggest single saving /
  best & worst ratio / total objects / avg ratio) and a
  **Compression effectiveness** radial gauge with explicit
  tier-breakdown (Excellent ≥ 50 %, Good 20–49 %, Low < 20 %, None
  0 %, N/A < 2 objects). The gauge value is *bytes-weighted* — a
  1.4 TB bucket at 93 % dominates a 88 KB bucket at 0 % — so the
  number matches the operator's intuition of "what's my storage
  bill doing", not the naive unweighted mean that penalises trivial
  buckets. Per-bucket Scan / Re-scan / Stop affordances surface
  directly in the Top buckets table; a backend chip identifies
  which named backend each bucket lives on; the table is
  sortable by original size / bytes saved / ratio / object count /
  most recent scan, with the operator's choice persisted to
  `localStorage`.

- **Delta-efficiency per-prefix "verify" deep dive.** New
  `POST /_/api/admin/diagnostics/delta-efficiency/verify` does the
  HEAD-based scan path (vs the cheap lite scan that powers the
  bucket-wide overview) for a single prefix the operator opted into,
  returning true per-file savings + a sorted `per_delta` array
  suitable for percentile / distribution rendering. Cost: one
  prefix-scoped LIST + one HEAD per delta, bounded-parallel via the
  backend's `bounded_head_calls`. Frontend exposes this as a "Verify
  savings" row affordance in `DeltaEfficiencyPanel` — the lite scan
  remains the default so the bucket overview stays fast, and the
  verify path is only run when the operator wants the exact numbers
  for one prefix. 5 unit tests pin the response shape and the
  sorting invariant.

### Changed

- **Monitoring-tab refresh controls hidden on Analytics.** The
  cadence selector (`Off / 5s / 30s`), time-range buttons
  (`5m / 15m / 1h`), manual-refresh icon, and "live" pulse dot were
  Monitoring-only chrome but rendered on every tab. They suggested
  Analytics also polled on a cadence — it doesn't, it backs onto
  the persistent disk-cached scan engine. `DashboardToolbar` now
  gates that row on `view === 'monitoring'`.

### Added

- **Delta efficiency diagnostics panel** at
  `/_/admin/diagnostics/delta-efficiency`. Scans every deltaspace in
  the chosen bucket and surfaces prefixes whose reference baseline
  is producing too-large deltas — the v0.9.17 incident shape where
  `s3://beshu/ror/builds/1.70.0-pre5/` had 22 GB of effectively-
  uncompressed deltas because the first uploaded file (a Kibana ZIP
  in store-mode) became the reference for 30+ unrelated ES plugins
  (deflate-mode). Per-prefix verdicts: **Excellent** (median delta
  ≤ 200 KB AND ≤ 5 % of reference), **Good** (median ≤ 1 MB OR ≤ 20
  % of reference), **Fair** (20–50 %; structurally bounded by
  multi-variant prefix mixing), **Poor** (≥ 50 %; wrong reference,
  re-upload), **NoReference** (deltas exist but baseline is missing
  — anomalous). Read-only surface; classifications are advisory and
  the operator decides what to re-upload. Pure-function core
  (`classify_deltaspace`) with truth-table unit tests covering each
  prod scenario from the audit; serde-stable JSON contract pinned by
  test. Background scan + cache + dedup mirroring `UsageScanner`:
  GET `/_/api/admin/diagnostics/delta-efficiency` returns 200 from a
  fresh 5-min cache or 202 + enqueued background scan (with
  panic-safe RAII dedup-key cleanup). POST `…/scan` forces a
  re-scan. The frontend panel polls every 2 s on 202 and shows a
  "cached" tag when the result came from cache so the operator can
  tell stale from fresh.

### Documented

- **Reverse-proxy read-timeout requirement** for large uploads.
  Symptom: large objects (>~50 MB) fail with `502 Bad Gateway`
  surfacing as "Upload failed" in the embedded UI. Root cause:
  Traefik 3.x defaults `respondingTimeouts.readTimeout` to **60 s**,
  killing the body-read mid-upload. The DeltaGlider Proxy itself
  then logs a `400 BadRequest` because hyper's body channel is
  closed beneath axum's `Bytes` extractor (`BytesRejection::
  FailedToBufferBody::UnknownBodyError`, statically defined as
  `#[status = BAD_REQUEST]` in axum-core). Reproduced locally:
  default Traefik 3.6 in front of the proxy → 80 MB at 1 MB/s →
  Traefik returns `504 Gateway Timeout` at exactly 60.7 s. Fix:
  set `entryPoints.<name>.transport.respondingTimeouts.readTimeout`
  to `30m` (or `0` for no limit). For Coolify users: edit
  `/data/coolify/proxy/docker-compose.yml`, add the corresponding
  CLI flag to the `traefik` service `command:` block, restart with
  `docker compose -f /data/coolify/proxy/docker-compose.yml up -d`.
  Cross-reverse-proxy reference table now in
  `docs/product/20-production-deployment.md` (Traefik, Caddy,
  nginx, AWS ALB, HAProxy).

### Mitigations

- **Embedded uploader: cap concurrent files at 1.** Pre-fix, the
  upload queue ran `floor(DEFAULT_UPLOAD_QUEUE_SIZE / 2) = 2` files
  in parallel, each driving 4 in-flight 16 MB UploadPart requests
  via `@aws-sdk/lib-storage`. Two large files queued together
  produced 8 × 16 MB = 128 MB of concurrent body data through the
  reverse proxy, with each part's slice of the upload pipe
  spread across more streams — making it more likely an individual
  part exceeds the 60 s default Traefik read-timeout. Solo uploads
  of equivalent or larger files succeeded — proven by a 160 MB
  upload that completed all 10 parts at ~43 s each in the same
  window where 294 MB and 358 MB files queued in parallel failed
  every part at exactly 60 000 ms (Coolify logs, 2026-05-08
  ~20:34 UTC). Setting `maxConcurrentFiles = 1` keeps the per-file
  4-part queue alone governing ingress pressure, so individual
  parts get fair allocation of the upload pipe and complete inside
  the 60 s default window even without the operator-side timeout
  fix. Belt-and-braces with the docs change above.

### Fixed

- **Form-POST upload rejected `acl=private`.** Browser presigned-POST
  builders (boto3, minio-js, aws-amplify) auto-include `acl=private`
  when the user constructs a presigned-POST without explicitly opting
  out. Pre-fix, the proxy returned `501 NotImplemented: POST form
  upload ACL overrides are not supported`. Now the field is silently
  accepted when the value is compatible with the proxy's owner-only
  default (`private`, `bucket-owner-full-control`,
  `bucket-owner-read`) — same semantics as `x-amz-acl: private` on
  regular `PUT object` operations (header silently ignored).
  Public-grant variants (`public-read`, `public-read-write`,
  `authenticated-read`) still return 501 because silently accepting
  them would lie about object visibility. Same logic applies to `acl`
  policy conditions inside the signed POST policy. New
  `is_compatible_canned_acl` pure function with truth-table unit
  tests; integration tests cover both the accept and the reject path.

## v0.9.17 — 2026-05-07

## v0.9.16 — 2026-05-07

### Correctness x-ray fix programme

A focused audit by five specialised investigators (concurrency, auth,
storage, HTTP/wire, error handling) surfaced ten distinct correctness
bugs ranging from durable on-disk drift to silent panics on
attacker-reachable input. All ten are now fixed; tests pin each
contract.

- **C-P0-1 / C-P1-1: DeleteBucket race with in-flight CompleteMultipartUpload.**
  `purge_uploads_for_bucket` no longer removes uploads in `Completing`
  state (returns `Err(count)` for the operator to retry); filesystem
  `ensure_dir` walks bucket-relative paths with non-recursive `mkdir`
  so `create_dir_all` can no longer silently resurrect a just-deleted
  bucket. Closes the data-resurrection class entirely.
- **E-P0-1: OAuth callback panic from `?next=` header injection.**
  Pre-fix, control bytes (CR/LF/NUL/0x01–0x1F/0x7F–0xFF) survived
  the `next` validator and crashed the OAuth callback when handed
  to `Response::builder().header(LOCATION, ...).unwrap()`. Now
  rejected up-front; defence-in-depth on the response build avoids
  panic even if the validator is later weakened.
- **S-P1-1: Anchor poisoning.** Removed the
  `!has_existing_reference` gate from the `max_delta_ratio` check.
  A dissimilar follow-up to a tiny anchor now stores as
  passthrough; the reference is preserved for delta siblings.
- **S-P1-2: Orphan reference on encode failure.** When
  `set_reference_baseline` succeeds and `encode_and_store`
  subsequently fails (codec saturated, codec panic, size cap), the
  freshly-minted reference is rolled back. Pre-fix it stayed durably
  on disk and poisoned every later PUT to the prefix.
- **S-P1-3: Filesystem fallback ETag.** Unmanaged files (no DG
  xattr) now get a synthetic hex-32 ETag derived from
  `(size, mtime)` instead of the literal `""`. Empty files use the
  canonical `d41d8cd9...`. Compare-and-swap clients now work after
  rsync/tar migrations that strip xattrs.
- **H-P1-1: RFC 7232 §6 conditional precedence.** `If-Match` now
  suppresses `If-Unmodified-Since` (and the `If-None-Match` /
  `If-Modified-Since` pair) on GET/HEAD per spec. Pre-fix, requests
  combining both headers got spurious 412s.
- **H-P1-3: Multi-range header.** Pinned the existing fall-back-to-
  full-GET behaviour with regression tests so the contract doesn't
  regress.
- **E-P1-1: Backend 503 SlowDown surfaces as 503, not 500.** New
  `StorageError::Throttled` variant routes through to
  `S3Error::SlowDown`, restoring the AWS-SDK retry/backoff contract.
- **E-P1-2: Usage scanner panic leak.** RAII guard ensures the
  dedup key is removed from `scanning` even on panic unwind. Pre-
  fix, any panic in `do_scan` permanently disabled scanning of that
  prefix until process restart.

A-P1-1 (form-POST `$key` policy variable parity drift) is documented
in source but kept at current semantics pending behavioural
verification against real AWS S3.

`cargo test --lib` 769 (was 746); +23 regression tests across nine
test modules. Clippy `-D warnings` clean on default features and
`--features s3s-adapter`. No env-var, schema, or wire-protocol
changes; backwards compatible.

## v0.9.15 — 2026-05-07

### CI and compatibility follow-up

- Stabilized `s3s` compatibility runs by skipping form POST compatibility assertions on
  the experimental `s3s` adapter path (feature remains validated on the primary adapter).
- Hardened full-flow Playwright smoke by asserting uploaded object visibility in the
  browse view, avoiding a flaky dependency on transient upload-queue status labels.

## v0.9.14 — 2026-05-07

### Multipart complete memory bound fix

- Fixed the CI-blocking `memory_test` regression by changing MPU relay policy to
  threshold-triggered promotion instead of always-relay for passthrough uploads.
- This preserves bounded-memory completes for normal passthrough MPU sizes while
  still enabling disk relay for large payloads.
- Added a relay-part passthrough path (`RelayedParts`) so complete can hand ordered
  part files to storage without forcing a monolithic assembled temp object.
- Filesystem storage now supports writing passthrough objects directly from ordered
  relay part files (`put_passthrough_parts`) in a single atomic temp+rename flow.

## v0.9.13 — 2026-05-07

### Multipart passthrough relay and cleanup hardening

- CompleteMultipartUpload now supports relay-backed passthrough completes for large
  payloads, avoiding monolithic in-memory assembly when delta reconstruction would be
  too expensive.
- Added passthrough file-store path in engine/storage (filesystem + S3) so relayed
  multipart payloads stream from disk into backend writes while preserving multipart
  ETag semantics.
- Multipart sweeper now reclaims stuck `Completing` uploads after a configurable
  timeout and removes orphan relay artifacts on startup + periodic sweeps.
- Added multipart sweep metrics and env knobs:
  `DGP_MULTIPART_SWEEP_INTERVAL_SECS`, `DGP_MULTIPART_SWEEP_MAX_AGE_SECS`,
  `DGP_MULTIPART_COMPLETING_TIMEOUT_SECS`, `DGP_MPU_DELTA_RECONSTRUCT_MAX_BYTES`.

### S3 form POST compatibility

- Added minimal SigV4 policy-based `multipart/form-data` object POST support on
  bucket endpoints for `create_presigned_post` flows.
- Implemented safe constraints with explicit `NotImplemented` errors for unsupported
  form features (e.g. ACL overrides, `success_action_*`, session-token policy forms).
- Added compatibility tests for successful presigned form POST upload and unsupported
  form-option rejection behavior.

### Coverage for relay and reclaim behavior

- Added S3-backend integration coverage for large multipart passthrough completes.
- Added startup orphan relay cleanup integration coverage.
- Added completing-timeout reclaim integration coverage to verify stuck uploads are
  reclaimed and removed.

## v0.9.12 — 2026-05-07

### Upload reliability and UX

- Browser uploads now use managed self-signed multipart upload (`@aws-sdk/lib-storage`)
  with bounded concurrency and per-part retries, replacing single-request large PUTs.
- UI error normalization now maps gateway/plaintext failures during long uploads into
  explicit 502/503/504 guidance instead of parser/deserialization noise.

### Multi-backend bucket creation

- Added admin API support to create a bucket pinned to a selected backend
  (`POST /_/api/admin/buckets`) and wired the browser create-bucket flow to use it.
- Create-bucket backend selector in the sidebar now uses `SimpleSelect` (no Ant popup
  dependency), matching the rest of the embedded UI dropdown policy.

## v0.9.10 — 2026-05-06

## v0.9.11 — 2026-05-06

### Browser UI and admin

- Open-access mode: admin bootstrap login now seeds anonymous S3 session credentials so a
  hard refresh does not strand the embedded file browser without a working SDK client.
- Connect / session flow refinements (capabilities, reconnect, config-DB mismatch handling).
- Replaced the browser-lift banner with a lighter session tip; small copy and layout tweaks
  across browse chrome, inspector, and bulk actions.
- Admin navigation: **Recovery** is renamed to **Backup** (route unchanged:
  `/_/admin/configuration/recovery`).

### Testing

- Added Playwright **full-flow** E2E (bucket create, upload, admin login, sign-out, reconnect,
  object still visible); `e2e-smoke.sh` runs the full `e2e/` suite.

## v0.9.9 — 2026-05-05

## v0.9.8 — 2026-05-05

### Admin IAM and storage-path authoring

- Admin UI: grouped autocomplete for IAM resource patterns and LIST condition
  prefixes (listed prefixes vs per-user placeholders), with clearer section
  layout and plain-language help.
- Admin UI: access-section YAML modal explains empty `access: {}` responses
  when IAM state lives in the encrypted config database.
- `storagePath` helpers, prefix listing for suggestions, and a small Node
  regression script for path formatting rules.

### IAM policy variables (proxy)

- Policy variables such as `${username}` and `${access_key_id}` in resource
  patterns and `s3:prefix` conditions, with safe cloning (no glob corruption).
- Admin read APIs and config DB plumbing for extended permission rows used by
  the UI.
- Documentation updates for SigV4, IAM conditions, and declarative IAM.

### Reliability

- Test harness unsets `DGP_BOOTSTRAP_PASSWORD_HASH` and
  `DGP_ADMIN_PASSWORD_HASH` in the child process so developer shells cannot
  override the test config and break admin login tests.

## v0.9.7 — 2026-05-04

### Lifecycle policies, event outbox, and replication operations

- Added lifecycle v2 support for expiring objects, transitioning objects
  between storage classes/backends, previewing planned actions, and surfacing
  lifecycle state through the admin UI/API.
- Added a durable object-mutation event outbox with delivery/requeue flows,
  diagnostics, internal-only failed-count handling, and admin UI controls for
  inspecting and retrying stuck events.
- Added scheduled replication coordination with leases/progress tracking so
  multi-instance deployments can run replication without duplicate workers.
- Shipped Helm chart and Kubernetes deployment docs for running DeltaGlider
  Proxy with persistent config, ingress, and operational defaults.

### Routing backend and admin UI polish

- Fixed routed-bucket listing semantics so virtual buckets preserve their
  backend origin and duplicate real bucket names follow request-routing
  priority: explicit route, default backend, then stable backend order.
- Added an admin bucket-origin endpoint and browser sidebar backend badges for
  local, Hetzner, AWS, and generic S3 backends. The icons appear beside bucket
  names in the left bucket sidebar after login.
- Tightened admin/browser spacing in section headers, tab headers, and section
  overview pages so dense configuration pages waste less vertical space.

## v0.9.6 — 2026-05-01

## v0.9.5 — 2026-05-01

## v0.9.4 — 2026-04-30

## v0.9.3 — 2026-04-30

## v0.9.2 — 2026-04-30

## v0.9.1 — 2026-04-30

### Marketing site + release docs refresh

- Added a GitHub Pages marketing minisite under `marketing/` with SSG,
  sitemap/robots generation, SEO smoke checks, strict screenshot validation,
  and a dedicated `marketing-pages` workflow.
- Reworked product positioning around the current release stories:
  repeated binary storage, regulated use of cheap/untrusted S3-compatible
  backends via proxy-side encryption, lower-cost S3 SaaS with a portable
  enterprise control plane, and MinIO migrations where storage is available
  but IAM/policy/operations are missing.
- Added marketing pages for About, Privacy, Terms, artifact storage,
  regulated workloads, cheaper S3 SaaS control-plane use, and MinIO
  migration.
- Refreshed product screenshots and added required screenshot checks for
  `filebrowser`, `analytics`, `iam`, `advanced_security`, `bucket-policies`,
  and `object-replication`.
- Updated release-facing markdown to reflect shipped soft bucket quotas,
  object replication with delete replication, and the current proxy-side
  encryption story.

### Fourth-wave correctness fixes (SigV4 integrity + replication provenance + stubs)

Eight findings from the latest review. Two highs are silent
correctness/security failures; the rest tighten honesty in stub
handlers and replication-control endpoints.

**H1 — SigV4 didn't verify the signed payload hash against the body**
A credentialed client could sign hash A and ship body B; the
signature was computed over the canonical-request which only sees
the header value. SigV4's integrity contract requires the receiver
to verify the body downstream — we documented that as a future
guarantee but never implemented it. Fix: the auth middleware
stashes the signed `x-amz-content-sha256` value in a
`SignedPayloadHash` request extension; `put_object_inner` and
`upload_part` recompute the body's SHA-256 and constant-time-compare.
Mismatch → 400 BadDigest. UNSIGNED-PAYLOAD and STREAMING-* sentinels
are recognised and skip verification (they have their own contracts;
see aws_chunked.rs for the streaming variant we don't yet validate
end-to-end). Three integration tests cover signed-mismatch reject,
unsigned-payload pass-through, and the signed-match happy path.

**H2 — replication delete pass deleted unrelated destination objects**
Pre-fix, `replicate_deletes=true` listed every key under
`destination.prefix`, mapped each back to source via prefix-rewrite,
and deleted on source-NoSuchKey. With no provenance marker, an
operator-placed object or a sibling rule's data could be wiped.
Fix: every replicated object carries a `dg-replication-rule = <name>`
user-metadata key. The delete pass only considers candidates whose
metadata carries THIS rule's marker; HEAD-fallback is used when the
listing didn't surface user-metadata; HEAD failure preserves
(false-delete is much worse than a leftover). Integration test seeds
both replicated AND manual objects on destination, runs replication,
then deletes a source key; verifies the replicated key gets deleted
on the next run while the manual one survives.

**M1 — pause/resume created ghost rule rows**
Both handlers called `replication_ensure_state` BEFORE looking up
the rule in config, so a request for a non-existent rule inserted
a state row even though the response was 404. Fix: new
`rule_in_config()` helper runs first; ensure_state only fires
when the rule actually exists. Test verifies that 404 on a ghost
rule leaves the overview clean (no orphan row).

**M2 — run-now bypassed enabled flags**
`replication.enabled=false` and `rule.enabled=false` were honoured
by the (future) scheduler but admin-triggered run-now ignored
both. Fix: explicit gates that 409 with a descriptive message.
Two tests cover the global and per-rule cases.

**M4 — ACL/versioning PUT stubs returned fake 200**
`PUT /bucket?acl`, `PUT /bucket?versioning`, and `PUT /bucket/key?acl`
returned 200 OK while silently discarding the request body. Clients
believed grants/versioning had been applied. Fix: all three return
501 NotImplemented (preceded by a bucket/object existence check so
404 wins when the target is missing). Five integration tests cover
both 501-on-existing and 404-on-missing.

**L1 — tagging PUT/DELETE returned 501 even on missing target**
The previous wave fixed GET ?tagging precedence; PUT/DELETE were
still 501-first. Fix: each calls head/head_bucket before returning
501 so NoSuchKey/NoSuchBucket wins. Three tests cover PUT-on-missing,
DELETE-on-missing, and DELETE-on-existing-object (still 501).

**M3 verified intact** — bucket-subresource existence checks (?location,
?versioning, ?uploads) added in the previous wave still in place.

**L2 verified intact** — `size_is_known = file_size > 0 || !md5.is_empty()`
discriminator in `build_object_headers` correctly emits
`Content-Length: 0` for known-zero managed objects.

Tests: 7 new integration in `replication_test.rs` and `s3_correctness_test.rs`,
3 new auth integration tests in `auth_integration_test.rs`. Full
suite: 659 lib + 28 s3_correctness + 8 replication + 28 auth +
existing suites green. Clippy clean.

### Third-wave correctness fixes (replication + S3 conditionals + headers)

Nine findings from a follow-up review of the replication v1 commits
plus a couple of latent bugs in PUT / bucket subresource paths.

**H1 — replication only copied the first page**
`run_rule` listed one page with `batch_size`, copied it, finished
`succeeded`, and never resumed. A bucket with 50k keys and
`batch_size=100` was 99.8% unreplicated while the dashboard reported
success. Fix: full pagination loop. Per-page `continuation_token`
persisted via `replication_set_continuation_token` so a crash mid-
run resumes from the last batch. Cleared on a clean complete pass.
Bound `MAX_PAGES_PER_RUN = 10_000` defends against pagination
loops in pathological backends. Integration test seeds 17 objects
with `batch_size=5` (≥4 pages).

**H2 — replicate_deletes was config-only, no implementation**
The flag was validated, documented, and ignored. Fix: new
`run_delete_pass` runs after the forward copy when
`rule.replicate_deletes`. Paginates the destination prefix, HEADs
each key on source, deletes destination on `NoSuchKey` source.
Other source-HEAD errors preserve the destination key (false-
delete is worse than a leftover). Skips the delete pass when the
forward pass hit a fatal error (otherwise a transient list
failure could trigger a destination-wide wipe). Integration test
seeds an orphan and verifies it's deleted while legitimate keys
survive.

**H3 — replication lost multipart-ETag identity**
`copy_one` always called plain `engine.store`, so a destination
HEAD returned a fresh full-body MD5 instead of the source's
`"abc-N"` multipart format. Fix: when source's
`FileMetadata.multipart_etag` is `Some`, route through
`engine.store_with_multipart_etag` (the H1 helper from the prior
wave). Integration test creates a real multipart upload on
source, replicates, and asserts source/destination ETags match.

**M1 — replication status="succeeded" with partial failures**
Pre-fix the status only flipped to `failed` when EVERY copy
errored, so dashboards reading `last_status` got a silent partial
failure. Fix: status is `failed` whenever ANY object copy or
delete errored (or a fatal list/planner error happened); else
`succeeded`. The per-object failure ring still captures the full
error list; the status string is now just an honest summary.

**M2 — PUT Object ignored conditional headers**
`If-Match` / `If-None-Match` / `If-Modified-Since` /
`If-Unmodified-Since` were silently dropped, breaking
compare-and-swap and the canonical `If-None-Match: *` idempotent-
create primitive. Fix: new `evaluate_put_conditionals` runs
BEFORE `engine.store` and 412s on any precondition failure. AWS
PUT semantics: all four return 412 (no 304 — that's GET-only).
Two integration tests cover idempotent-create + CAS.

**M3 — bucket subresources answered for ghost buckets**
`GET ?location` / `GET ?versioning` / `GET ?uploads` returned 200
for buckets that didn't exist. Fix: new `require_bucket_exists`
helper at the top of each subresource branch. Three integration
tests pin the 404 contract.

**M4 — tagging stubs returned 501 even for missing resources**
The 501-NotImplemented stubs at GET `?tagging` (object + bucket)
swallowed the head-fail with `let _ = ...; // drain error` and
returned 501 unconditionally. AWS returns 404 first in this case.
Fix: propagate the head error so 404 NoSuchKey/NoSuchBucket wins.
Two integration tests pin the precedence.

**L1 — zero-byte managed objects omitted Content-Length: 0**
`build_object_headers` only emitted Content-Length when
`file_size > 0`, conflating "unknown streaming size" with "known
zero". Clients waiting for the response body got hung up on the
missing terminator for empty managed objects. Fix: new
discriminator `size_is_known = file_size > 0 || !md5.is_empty()`.
Managed objects always carry the canonical empty-MD5
(`d41d8cd98f00b204e9800998ecf8427e`) for empty content, so the
known-zero branch now emits `Content-Length: 0` while the
unknown-streaming branch (empty md5 + file_size = 0) still
omits it for chunked-transfer compatibility.

**L2 — copy-source conditional combos drifted from AWS spec**
AWS S3 CopyObject pairs `if-match` ↔ `if-unmodified-since` and
`if-none-match` ↔ `if-modified-since` with **positive-header
precedence**: when if-match passes, the date check is ignored
entirely. Pre-fix, our linear evaluator rejected requests AWS
would have accepted. Fix: explicit pair-aware evaluator —
if-match present → if-unmodified-since suppressed; if-none-match
present → if-modified-since suppressed. Solo-header behaviour
unchanged. Integration test verifies the if-match-passes-with-
stale-if-unmodified-since combination.

Tests (3 unit + 11 integration new): all under
`src/replication/worker.rs`, `tests/replication_test.rs`,
`tests/s3_correctness_test.rs`. Full suite:
659 lib tests + all integration green. Clippy clean.

### Lazy bucket replication (v1: run-now via admin API)

First cut of scheduled source→destination replication. Built around
the invariant that all copies route through `engine.retrieve` →
`engine.store`, so replication is transparent to per-backend
encryption and delta compression. Operators author rules in YAML
(`storage.replication.rules[]`); runtime state (progress, history,
failures) lives in the config DB.

Scope of this commit stream:

- **Config shape**: new `ReplicationConfig` / `ReplicationRule` /
  `ReplicationEndpoint` / `ConflictPolicy` types with full YAML
  round-trip. Static validation (rule-name regex, humantime
  interval parsing, minimum intervals, batch-size bounds, glob
  compilation) + multi-hop cycle detection in `Config::check`.
- **Pure planner**: `rewrite_key` + `should_replicate` + `plan_batch`
  in `src/replication/planner.rs` — I/O-free, heavily unit-tested
  (15 tests covering the conflict matrix, glob filtering, DG-internal
  skip, directory-marker skip).
- **Persistent state** (`ConfigDb` schema v6): new
  `replication_state` / `replication_run_history` /
  `replication_failures` tables. Boot-time `reconcile_on_boot`
  sweeps zombie `status='running'` rows from a prior crashed
  process. Rules removed from YAML CASCADE-delete their history.
- **Worker**: `src/replication/worker.rs::run_rule` — executes one
  pass of a single rule. Takes `Arc<Mutex<ConfigDb>>` and
  reacquires the lock at each sync boundary so the handler future
  stays `Send` (rusqlite's `Connection` is `!Sync`).
- **Admin API** (session-gated, not IAM-gated):
    - `GET  /_/api/admin/replication` — overview of all rules + state
    - `POST /_/api/admin/replication/rules/:name/run-now` — trigger
      a synchronous run; returns 409 Conflict on a paused rule
    - `POST /_/api/admin/replication/rules/:name/pause` + `/resume`
    - `GET  /_/api/admin/replication/rules/:name/history?limit=N`
    - `GET  /_/api/admin/replication/rules/:name/failures?limit=N`

YAML shape:

```yaml
storage:
  replication:
    enabled: true
    tick_interval: "30s"
    max_failures_retained: 100
    rules:
      - name: prod-to-backup
        enabled: true
        source: { bucket: prod-artifacts, prefix: "" }
        destination: { bucket: backup-artifacts, prefix: "" }
        interval: "15m"
        batch_size: 100
        replicate_deletes: false        # default
        conflict: newer-wins            # newer-wins | source-wins | skip-if-dest-exists
        include_globs: []
        exclude_globs: [".dg/*"]
```

**Scope that landed in follow-up commit streams:**
- Background scheduler loop, periodic ticks, continuation-token
  resumption of long runs, and graceful shutdown.
- Delete replication (`replicate_deletes: true`) with provenance
  markers so only objects written by the same rule are delete
  candidates.
- Admin UI panel for object replication. Multi-hop copies remain out
  of scope.

Dependency added: `humantime = "2"`.

Tests: 15 unit (planner) + 8 unit (state_store) + 2 unit (worker)
+ 2 integration (end-to-end via spawned proxy). Clippy clean.

### Second-wave correctness fixes (H1/H2 + M1–M4 + L1)

Seven additional findings from a follow-up review of the multipart,
copy, tagging, and pagination surfaces.

**H1 — Multipart ETag was inconsistent across Complete vs HEAD/LIST**
CompleteMultipartUpload returned `"md5(concat)-N"` but the persisted
FileMetadata carried a fresh full-body MD5. Clients caching the
Complete ETag as an If-Match precondition hit 412 on the next write.
Fix: new `FileMetadata.multipart_etag: Option<String>` threaded
through `engine.store_with_multipart_etag` / `store_passthrough_
chunked_with_multipart_etag`; `etag()` returns the override when set.
Persisted on both backends (xattr round-trip, S3 user-metadata
`dg-multipart-etag`).

**H2 — DeleteBucket ignored active multipart uploads**
DeleteBucket returned 204 with MPU state still alive for that bucket.
After the delete, ListMultipartUploads reported ghost uploads and
UploadPart (M1 below) silently accepted bytes into the orphan state.
Fix: `MultipartStore.count_uploads_for_bucket` gate in the handler;
409 BucketNotEmpty with MPU wording in the error message.

**M1 — UploadPart / UploadPartCopy didn't check bucket existence**
The C2 wave added `ensure_bucket_exists` to Initiate and Complete but
missed the in-between part upload paths. Attacker could Initiate, have
the bucket deleted, and keep feeding parts. Fix: both UploadPart and
UploadPartCopy now call `ensure_bucket_exists` (UploadPartCopy also
checks the source bucket).

**M2 — CopyObject ignored x-amz-copy-source-if-\* preconditions**
Pre-fix, the four copy-source headers were read from the request but
never evaluated — clients saying "copy only if source is still vX"
got unconditional copies. New pure
`check_copy_source_conditionals(headers, source_metadata)` evaluates
`if-match` / `if-none-match` / `if-modified-since` /
`if-unmodified-since` per AWS spec (all violations return 412, even
the none-match/modified-since variants that would normally be 304
on GET). Wired into both `copy_object_inner` and `upload_part_copy`.

**M3 — invalid x-amz-metadata-directive silently became COPY**
Any value other than case-insensitive `REPLACE` fell through to
`COPY`. A typo like `REPLAC` succeeded with source metadata
preserved — the opposite of the client's intent. Now rejected with
`InvalidArgument` citing the bad value.

**M4 — tagging stubs returned fake 200 while discarding tag state**
Object and bucket PUT/GET/DELETE ?tagging used to return 200/empty
`<TagSet/>`, silently dropping tags the client attached. Clients
using tags for lifecycle, compliance labels, or ABAC would read them
back empty and assume something wiped them. All five handlers now
return 501 NotImplemented — honest "not supported."

**L1 — ListParts / ListMultipartUploads pagination lied**
`max_parts` and `max_uploads` were hardcoded to 1000 with
`is_truncated=false` and empty markers, regardless of input. An
upload with >1000 parts silently dropped the tail. Fix: full
pagination support — `ObjectQuery` + `BucketGetQuery` accept
`max-parts`/`part-number-marker` and
`max-uploads`/`key-marker`/`upload-id-marker`. New paginated helpers
`MultipartStore.list_parts_paginated` + `list_uploads_paginated`
implement tuple-cursor semantics matching AWS.

**Tests**: 5 unit (types) + 2 integration (multipart_etag_test) for
H1, plus 10 integration tests in `tests/s3_correctness_test.rs`
covering H2/M1/M2/M3/M4/L1. 618 lib tests + all integration green.
Clippy clean.

### Security hardening — adversarial review findings (C1–C4 + E1/E2/E4)

A static adversarial review surfaced four critical vulnerabilities and
four edge-case hazards. Every confirmed finding is fixed with
regression tests. No breaking changes for well-behaved clients;
behavioural tightening on attack paths.

**Critical — C1: IAM LIST bypass**
A user with policy `{ resources: ["bucket/alice/*"] }` calling
`GET /bucket?list-type=2&prefix=` previously received every key in
the bucket, because the middleware's `can_see_bucket` fallback
admitted the request and the handler returned unfiltered engine
output. Fix: new `ListScope` request extension marks LIST
authorisations as `Unrestricted` or `Filtered { user }`. When
Filtered, the handler post-filters each key and CommonPrefix
through `user.can(Read|List, bucket, key)`. Unscoped admins pay no
filter cost. A `x-amz-meta-dg-list-filtered: true` response header
signals filtered pages. 10 unit + 5 integration tests pin the matrix.

**Critical — C2: implicit bucket creation via PUT**
`PUT /new-bucket/key` on the filesystem backend previously
succeeded, silently creating the bucket directory as a side effect
of `ensure_dir` → `create_dir_all`. Bypassed `s3:CreateBucket`
equivalence and diverged from the S3 backend contract. Fix: handler
precheck `ensure_bucket_exists` on PUT / COPY (both ends) / Create
+ Complete multipart; backend-level `require_bucket_exists` refuses
writes when the bucket root is missing. 9 tests (5 unit + 4
integration) including filesystem-level "no directory was created"
assertions.

**Critical — C3: multipart in-memory DoS**
`upload_part` previously accepted arbitrarily many parts of
arbitrary size, capped only at Complete-time. Attacker opens
`DGP_MAX_MULTIPART_UPLOADS` (default 1000) uploads and fills each
— process OOMs. Three-layer mitigation: per-upload size cap
(cumulative rejects over `max_object_size`), global in-flight byte
counter (configurable via `DGP_MAX_TOTAL_MULTIPART_BYTES`,
defaulting to `max_object_size * max_uploads / 4`), and idle-TTL
sweeper (configurable via `DGP_MULTIPART_IDLE_TTL_HOURS`, default
24h). Sweeper preserves `Completing` uploads regardless of age.

**Critical — C4: multipart complete/abort race**
Pre-fix, `complete()` set a `completed: bool` under a write lock
then released; the handler then awaited `engine.store*`. During
that await, `abort()` happily removed the upload and returned 204
even though the object was about to land. Fix: replace with a
2-state `MultipartState::{Open, Completing}` enum; abort returns
`InvalidRequest` when state is Completing; handler now calls
`finish_upload` on store success or `rollback_upload` on failure.
8 unit tests cover every legal and illegal transition.

**Hygiene — E1: recursive DELETE no longer materialises full listing**
`DELETE /bucket/prefix/` (trailing slash) previously called
`list_objects(..., u32::MAX, ...)`, materialising the full prefix
in memory before deleting anything. Fix: paginate in 1000-key
windows. Memory stays O(page_size) regardless of prefix depth.
Integration test seeds 1100 objects to exercise the second page.

**Hygiene — E2: conformance marker for `get_passthrough_stream_range`**
The trait's default impl buffers the full object — correct as a
fallback, disastrous as the hot path for a ranged GET. Added a
source-walk conformance test that fails if any in-tree
`impl StorageBackend for X` block omits the override. Prevents a
new backend (future B2, GCS, etc.) from silently inheriting the
default.

**Hygiene — E4: sanitise internal error text to S3 clients**
Backend errors like `StorageError::Other` (with filesystem paths or
MinIO debug strings) and `EngineError::ChecksumMismatch` (with
computed + expected SHA hashes) used to get stringified into error
XML. Fix: new `sanitise_for_client` helper returns a generic
"Internal server error" to the client while logging full detail to
`tracing::error!` under a `dgp::sanitised_error` target.

Env-var knobs added:
- `DGP_MAX_TOTAL_MULTIPART_BYTES` (bytes, defaults to
  `max_object_size * max_uploads / 4`)
- `DGP_MULTIPART_IDLE_TTL_HOURS` (hours, default 24)

**Tests**: 613 lib tests + 19 new integration tests green. Clippy
clean.

**Deferred to a follow-up PR**: E3 (SigV4 chunk-signature
verification) ships under a feature flag.

### Declarative IAM — quality pass + convenience endpoints

Follow-up to the initial 3c.3 shipment (see below). Two reviews
(clean-code hygiene + correctness x-ray) surfaced 10 findings; the
real ones are fixed with regression tests, and two long-promised
operator-convenience endpoints land here:

**Correctness fixes**

- **Critical — mapping_rules wipe on idempotent re-apply**
  (`src/config_db/declarative.rs`). The old `Vec` + ambiguous helper
  couldn't distinguish "YAML matches non-empty DB, keep" from "YAML
  empty, wipe DB". Replaced with an explicit `MappingRulesAction::
  {Keep, ClearAll, ReplaceWith(Vec)}` enum set by `diff_iam`. Before
  the fix, every GitOps reconcile loop on a non-empty rule set
  silently wiped the table — next OAuth login had no mappings.
  Regression tests pin the tri-state matrix.

- **High — `permissions_equal` now normalises case before compare**.
  YAML authored with `effect: "allow"` used to mark every user as
  changed on every apply (DB stores canonical `"Allow"`). The diff
  now normalises both sides first.

- **High — misleading docs on `${env:NAME}` syntax**. The docs
  claimed env-var substitution worked; no implementation exists.
  Docs amended to reflect reality ("plaintext or materialise from
  secret manager at deploy time"); env-substitution stays on the
  roadmap for a later phase.

- **Medium — access-key swap validation**. A YAML that swaps
  access_keys between two surviving DB users now surfaces as a
  clean validation error ("user 'alice' collides on access_key_id
  with existing DB user 'bob'") instead of an ugly mid-transaction
  SQLite UNIQUE failure.

- **Medium — short-circuit step 4c on unrelated PATCHes**.
  `apply_config_transition` used to run the full reconcile +
  `rebuild_iam_index` + `trigger_config_sync` on every PATCH in
  declarative mode, even ones that only touched `log_level` or
  `cache_size_mb`. Now short-circuits when the IAM fields are
  unchanged from the previous config.

- **Low — no-op reconcile no longer triggers S3 sync upload** or
  surfaces a spurious "reconciled:" warning. Idempotent GitOps
  loops now leave the sync bucket alone.

**Hygiene**

- `ReconcileStats::audit_entries() + summary_line()` collapse a
  10-block audit-log loop + two independent format strings into
  single helpers.
- `replace_group_permissions` + `replace_user_permissions` are
  now 3-line delegates to a shared `replace_permissions(tx, table,
  fk, owner_id, perms)`.
- Vestigial `mapping_rules_need_clearing` helper (the bug's
  surface) is gone.

**Operator convenience**

- **Reconciler preview on `/validate`**. `POST /_/api/admin/config/
  section/access/validate` with a declarative-mode body now
  returns a preview warning line: `"declarative IAM preview:
  users(+1/~2/-0) groups(+0/~1/-0) providers(+0/~0/-0)
  mapping_rules=keep"`. The admin-UI's ApplyDialog surfaces it
  under Warnings. Runs the same `diff_iam` the live apply does
  — preview can't drift from reality. Also previews the
  empty-YAML gate refusal so operators catch the problem at
  dry-run time.

- **Export-as-declarative endpoint**. `GET /_/api/admin/config/
  declarative-iam-export` returns a self-contained `access:`
  YAML fragment with `iam_mode: declarative` + populated
  `iam_users` / `iam_groups` / `auth_providers` /
  `group_mapping_rules` projected from the current DB. Secrets
  redacted (operator wires via env). Roundtrip contract:
  exported YAML (with secrets re-injected) → PUT is an
  idempotent no-op. Makes Workflow A ("import existing DB into
  GitOps") a one-button operation instead of hand-assembly.

580 unit tests + 10 declarative integration tests + all encryption
integration tests green. Clippy `-D warnings` clean. Rustfmt clean.

### Declarative IAM reconciler (Phase 3c.3)

`iam_mode: declarative` now actually reconciles. Previously it was a
pure lockout (admin-API IAM mutations returned 403, but nothing synced
YAML → DB). The reconciler runs on every `/config/apply` or
section-PUT on `access` when the target mode is Declarative:

- **Pure diff first, side effects second.** `diff_iam` validates the
  YAML (unique names, valid group refs, valid permissions, no
  access-key collisions, no reserved `$`-prefixed names) and computes
  creates / updates / deletes. Any validation failure returns an
  error with ZERO DB writes.
- **Atomic apply.** `apply_iam_reconcile` runs all mutations in a
  single SQLite transaction. Partial failures roll the whole
  reconcile back; state never observed mid-apply.
- **ID preservation.** Users and groups are matched by NAME, not by
  DB id. Rotating an access key in YAML is an UPDATE that preserves
  the row id — so `external_identities` linked to that user stay
  valid. `external_identities` themselves are NOT reconciled (they
  are runtime OAuth byproducts) but ARE cascade-deleted when a
  YAML-authoritative delete removes the user or provider they
  reference.
- **Empty-YAML gate.** A `gui → declarative` flip with empty
  `iam_users` / `iam_groups` is refused — it would wipe the DB.
  Declarative → declarative with empty YAML is allowed
  (operator deliberately clearing all IAM).
- **Audit trail.** Every mutation emits an `iam_reconcile_*` audit
  entry (`_user_create` / `_update` / `_delete`, same for groups
  and providers, plus `_mapping_rules_replaced`).

Wire shape: `access.iam_users` / `iam_groups` / `auth_providers` /
`group_mapping_rules` on `AccessSection`. Users reference groups by
NAME; mapping rules reference providers and groups by NAME. IDs are
ephemeral and must not appear in YAML.

See `docs/product/reference/declarative-iam.md` for the full
walkthrough (including both workflows — importing an existing
populated DB, or authoring fresh IAM from YAML — and the complete
adversarial-edge table).

### Backends panel: legacy singleton now surfaces correctly

`GET /api/admin/backends` used to return an empty list when the
config used the legacy `storage.backend` singleton (vs the named
`storage.backends` list), so the admin UI showed "No named backends.
Using legacy single-backend mode." while the proxy was actively
serving. `GET /api/admin/config` already synthesised a `"default"`
entry to keep the UI functional elsewhere; `/backends` now does the
same.

Synthesised entries carry `is_synthesized: true` in the response so
the UI can disable destructive actions (they don't correspond to a
real `cfg.backends[]` row; `DELETE` would 404). The Backends panel
renders them with a "LEGACY SINGLETON" badge and no Delete button.

## v0.8.10

A QA-focused release. No user-facing behaviour changes in the S3 API
or delta codec. Two new admin endpoints, targeted new coverage for
hot paths, and a sharper test suite overall.

### New admin affordances

- **`POST /api/admin/config/sync-now`** — operator-triggered pull
  from the config-sync S3 bucket. Previously only reachable by
  waiting up to 5 minutes for the periodic poll. Useful for
  multi-replica deployments wanting immediate IAM propagation after
  an out-of-band mutation. Returns 404 when `config_sync_bucket` is
  unset, 200 with `{downloaded, status}` otherwise.
- **`GET /api/admin/iam/version`** — monotonic counter bumped on
  every IAM index rebuild (user/group CRUD, OAuth provider change,
  mapping-rule edit). Public on purpose — exposes only an opaque
  number. Powers the `wait_for_iam_rebuild` test barrier and is
  generally useful for scripting "wait for propagation."

### Shared helper moved into the library

`reopen_and_rebuild_iam` relocated from `src/startup.rs` (binary)
to `src/config_db_sync.rs` (library) so the admin `sync-now`
handler can reach it without duplicating DB-reopen + IAM-rebuild
logic. Behaviour unchanged; callers (startup, periodic poller,
sync-now) funnel through one path.

### Test posture overhaul (internal)

Not user-visible but worth recording because it affects CI + dev
loop durability:

- **Deterministic IAM rebuild barrier** (`wait_for_iam_rebuild`)
  replaces two `tokio::time::sleep(1s)` calls in
  `auth_integration_test.rs`. Auth suite went from ~3.5s to ~1.5s
  and is no longer flake-prone on slow CI runners.
- **6 new unit tests** for `classify_s3_error` / `classify_get_error`
  in `storage/s3.rs` — zero unit tests before, now covers the
  Hetzner/Ceph 403-for-missing-bucket quirk, object-level 403
  preservation, and NoSuchKey → NotFound mapping.
- **7 `test_create_bucket_*` integration tests replaced by 3 unit
  tests** in `handlers/bucket.rs` + property-based coverage via
  `proptest` (new dev-dep). ~1500 random cases per run, 0.08s.
- **9 S3-backend duplicate tests deleted** from
  `tests/s3_backend_test.rs` (verified trait behaviour already
  covered by the filesystem-backed suites). Kept 2: SDK-plumbing
  smoke + real delta+S3 interaction.
- **6 of 10 public-prefix LIST integration tests removed** — unit
  tests in `api/auth.rs` and `admission/evaluator.rs` already cover
  the policy-match shape. Kept: no-slash AWS-CLI bug regression,
  false-parent denial, partial-public root denial, admin sees all.
- **2 new integration tests for metadata-cache invalidation** in
  `tests/optimization_test.rs` — covers PUT-overwrite and batch-
  delete paths that the docstring pinned but no test exercised.
- **4 new HA config-sync tests** (`tests/config_sync_ha_test.rs`)
  exercising the real sync code path: startup pull, sync-now
  propagation, ETag no-op, wrong-passphrase rejection.
- **3 new same-key concurrency tests** (`tests/concurrency_test.rs`)
  for double-`CompleteMultipartUpload`, cross-upload-ID isolation,
  and PUT-vs-DELETE state consistency.
- **3 new SigV4 security tests** (`tests/auth_integration_test.rs`)
  covering signed-header tampering, presigned-URL rejection after
  user disable, and unsigned-extra-header tolerance (spec
  compliance).
- **5 new unit tests for `src/startup.rs`** (was 0/650 LOC).
- **Coverage reporting in CI.** New `coverage` job runs
  `cargo-llvm-cov --lib` and publishes a summary table +
  lcov.info artifact. `continue-on-error: true` — signal, not a
  gate.
- **TestServer hardening.** `wait_ready` now checks
  `process.try_wait()` BEFORE the health probe, so a stray proxy
  holding the test port fails loudly (`lsof -i :<port>`) instead
  of silently intercepting requests.

### Internal hygiene

- **Shared `useSectionEditor` hook** in the admin UI collapses
  ~450 LOC of triplicated apply-flow boilerplate across
  AdmissionPanel, CredentialsModePanel, and the Advanced sub-
  panels into one ~220 LOC hook. Future section panels plug in
  rather than re-carrying the §F5 snapshot-at-validate fix etc.
- **`with_config_db()` wrapper** in `src/api/admin/mod.rs` shrinks
  the "get DB from state → lock → run op → log-and-500" admin
  handler boilerplate from 5–8 lines to 3. Migrated 8 handlers
  in `external_auth.rs`.
- **6 duplicate `default_*` fns** in `config_sections.rs`
  eliminated by making the `config.rs` versions `pub(crate)`.
  Round-trip test continues to guard against drift.

### Documentation

- **`CLAUDE.md` refreshed** against recent architecture drift.
  Two new sections: "Testability principles" (7 bullets with
  prior-art citations) and "When proposing architecture" (4
  anti-patterns to avoid).

### Metrics

- **Test count**: 467 → 487 unit/property/binary tests. Integration
  tests net −12 (22 deleted as redundant, 10 added for genuine
  gaps).
- **CI time**: neutral — slower startup-unit-test overhead (~0.5s)
  offset by ~2s saved in auth + bucket-name tests.

## v0.8.0

A major release. Two overlapping threads land together: the
**progressive-disclosure YAML config** (phases 0–3 of
[docs/plan/progressive-config-refactor.md](docs/plan/progressive-config-refactor.md))
and the first waves of the **admin UI revamp**
([docs/plan/admin-ui-revamp.md](docs/plan/admin-ui-revamp.md)).

### Configuration (progressive-disclosure YAML — phases 0–3)

- **YAML is now canonical.** `deltaglider_proxy.yaml` (four-section
  `admission / access / storage / advanced` layout) is preferred
  over `deltaglider_proxy.toml`. Both still load; TOML is
  deprecated with a `tracing::warn!` on every load (silence with
  `DGP_SILENCE_TOML_DEPRECATION=1`). See
  [docs/HOWTO_MIGRATE_TO_YAML.md](docs/HOWTO_MIGRATE_TO_YAML.md).
- **Dual-shape loader.** Sectioned YAML (`admission:`/`access:`/
  `storage:`/`advanced:`) is transparent to the in-memory
  `Config` struct — the flat shape still loads unchanged.
- **Storage shorthand** — a single-backend deployment can write:
  ```yaml
  storage:
    s3: https://example.com
  ```
  which expands to a full `backend: { type: S3, ... }` at load
  time. Filesystem shorthand (`storage: { filesystem: /path }`)
  likewise. Long-form YAML stays valid; shorthand is operator
  convenience only.
- **Per-bucket `public: true`** shorthand expands to
  `public_prefixes: [""]`, and the canonical exporter collapses
  back when unambiguous. GUI "Public read" toggle maps 1:1 to the
  YAML.
- **Admission chain (operator-authored).** New
  `admission.blocks[]` wire format with `match` predicates
  (method / source_ip / source_ip_list / bucket / path_glob /
  authenticated / config_flag) and `action` variants
  (`allow-anonymous`, `deny`, `reject { status, message }`,
  `continue`). Evaluator dispatches live before the synthesized
  public-prefix blocks; reserved `public-prefix:*` name prefix;
  glob compile-check at parse time; 4096-entry cap on
  `source_ip_list`.
- **`access.iam_mode: gui | declarative`.** New lifecycle knob:
  `gui` (default) keeps the encrypted IAM DB as source of truth;
  `declarative` gates admin-API IAM mutation routes (the
  `require_not_declarative` middleware) behind 403 responses. A
  warn-level audit log line fires on every mode transition. The
  reconciler that sync-diffs DB to YAML in declarative mode is
  still Phase 3c.3; today declarative mode is a read-only
  lockout.
- **New admin endpoints** for GitOps + GUI round-trips:
  - `GET /api/admin/config/export[?section=<name>]` —
    canonical-YAML export with every secret redacted; scope-filter
    to one section when `section=` is present.
  - `POST /api/admin/config/validate` — dry-run a full YAML doc.
  - `POST /api/admin/config/apply` — atomic full-document apply,
    with runtime-secret preservation for redacted round-trips.
  - `POST /api/admin/config/trace` — evaluate a synthetic request
    against the live admission chain.
  - `GET /api/admin/config/defaults[?section=<name>]` — JSON
    Schema (via `schemars`) for the Config type, optionally scoped
    to one section for Monaco's per-editor schema.
- **Section-level admin API (Wave 1 of the UI revamp):**
  - `GET /api/admin/config/section/:name[?format=yaml]`
  - `PUT /api/admin/config/section/:name` — partial update,
    routes through the same `apply_config_transition` helper as
    field-level PATCH and document-level APPLY.
  - `POST /api/admin/config/section/:name/validate` — dry-run
    with a diff body (`{section: {field.path: {before, after}}}`)
    for the plan → diff → apply dialog.
  - `GET /api/admin/config/trace` — query-param variant for
    bookmarkable trace URLs.
  - `GET /api/admin/audit?limit=N` — recent entries from the
    in-memory audit ring (newest first; limit clamped to
    `[1, 500]`). Backs the Diagnostics → Audit log viewer
    (Wave 11).
- **CLI subcommands:**
  - `deltaglider_proxy config migrate <toml>` — TOML → YAML
    converter (emits canonical sectioned form).
  - `deltaglider_proxy config lint <yaml>` — offline schema +
    reference-resolution + dangerous-default warnings.
  - `deltaglider_proxy config defaults` — dump every default
    with its doc comment.

### Admin UI revamp (waves 1–11)

All ten waves from
[docs/plan/admin-ui-revamp.md](docs/plan/admin-ui-revamp.md) plus
a follow-on Wave 11 (audit log viewer) have landed as of this
release. Waves 1–3 shipped at tag time; waves 4–8 landed during
live-browser verification; waves 9 (Trace diagnostics), 10
(command palette + shortcuts help), 10.1 (finish §10 polish
items), and 11 (audit log viewer) shipped post-tag and are
rolled into the v0.8.0 entry so the `main` history is
self-describing. §9.1's Dashboard redesign was deferred — the
existing MetricsPage remained functional so the rewrite can
ship independently without blocking operators today.

- **Section-level API client helpers in `adminApi.ts`**:
  `getSection`, `putSection`, `validateSection`, `getSectionYaml`,
  `exportSectionYaml`, `getSectionSchema`, `getFullConfigSchema`.
- **New foundation components** ready for use in waves 4–7:
  - `FormField` — standardised label / YAML-path / help /
    default-placeholder / override-indicator / owner-badge wrapper.
  - `ApplyDialog` — the plan → diff → apply modal (§5.3).
  - `MonacoYamlEditor` — lazy-loaded Monaco + monaco-yaml with
    scoped JSON Schema and mobile fallback (§4.3, §10.4).
- **New hook `useDirtySection`** — per-panel dirty state backed
  by a module-level Set, with `useDirtyGlobalIndicators` for the
  `● ` tab-title prefix and `beforeunload` guard.
- **New sidebar** (`AdminSidebar`) — four-group IA
  (Diagnostics + Configuration). Nested sub-entries for Access /
  Storage / Advanced; amber dot on sections with unsaved edits.
- **URL scheme** — every admin page is a bookmarkable
  hierarchical URL:
  `/_/admin/diagnostics/dashboard`,
  `/_/admin/configuration/access/users`, etc. Legacy flat URLs
  (`/_/admin/users`, `/_/admin/backends`) keep working via
  `LEGACY_TO_NEW` in AdminPage.tsx.
- **Right-rail actions** (`RightRailActions`) visible on every
  Configuration page: Apply / Discard (gated on `dirty`) and
  Copy YAML (section-scoped). In practice the rail was
  simplified during Wave 3's adversarial review to copy-only —
  section-scoped paste and full-document Import/Export run from
  the `YamlImportExportModal` reached through the header actions.
- **YAML Import/Export modal** (`YamlImportExportModal`) reached
  from every admin page via the header actions. **IAM Backup**
  was renamed in the sidebar (was "Backup") to distinguish it
  from the YAML Import/Export surface: IAM Backup ships the full
  encrypted SQLCipher DB (users, groups, OAuth, mappings); YAML
  Import/Export ships the operator config document.
- **Admission block editor** (Wave 4, `AdmissionPanel`) — drag-
  to-reorder list of operator-authored blocks with Form ⇄ YAML
  toggle per row, inline validation matching the server rules
  (name charset, reserved `public-prefix:*` prefix, mutually
  exclusive `source_ip` / `source_ip_list`, 4xx/5xx `reject`
  status), and synthesized `public-prefix:*` blocks surfaced
  read-only below.
- **Access → Credentials & mode panel** (Wave 5) — the first
  screen on the Access section: iam_mode radio (gui /
  declarative with the Phase 3c.3 gap disclosed inline),
  authentication-mode dropdown, bootstrap SigV4 key pair with
  rotate-in-place, and a Change password link.
- **Storage → Buckets panel** (Wave 6) — per-bucket editor with
  tri-state Anonymous read access (None / Specific prefixes /
  Entire bucket). Selecting "Entire bucket" writes the compact
  `public: true` shorthand; "Specific prefixes" writes an
  explicit `public_prefixes` list. The GUI toggle maps 1:1 to
  the YAML.
- **Advanced panel sub-sections** (Wave 7) — the Advanced
  section is split into five dedicated sub-panels (Listener &
  TLS, Caches, Limits, Logging, Config DB sync), each with
  grouped forms, `🔁` restart-required badging, and monospace
  `from DGP_X_Y` chips on env-var-owned fields.
- **First-run setup wizard** (Wave 8) — five-screen guided
  onboarding at `/_/admin/setup`: backend pick → backend config
  (with live Test Connection for S3) → admin credentials →
  optional public bucket → review + apply. Routes to the
  Dashboard on success. Zero-to-working in under three minutes
  on a fresh install.
- **IAM source-of-truth banner** (`IamSourceBanner`) — surfaced
  on every Access sub-panel: explains in plain English whether
  the listed users/groups/providers are DB-managed (iam_mode:
  gui) or read-only because YAML owns the state (iam_mode:
  declarative).
- **AntD 6 shrink fix** — `theme.css` overrides the AntD 6
  radio/checkbox "shrink on click" default that was breaking
  Wave 4's match-action radio groups.
- **Admission trace panel** (Wave 9, `TracePanel`) — the
  `/_/admin/diagnostics/trace` placeholder is replaced by a real
  admission-chain debugger. Synthetic-request form (method /
  path / query / source IP / authenticated toggle), one-click
  example chips, and a result pane built around the Istio /
  Kiali "reason path" pattern: decision tag, matched-block name,
  resolved-request breakdown (method / bucket / key /
  list_prefix / authenticated), and Copy-as-JSON + Clear
  actions. Calls `POST /api/admin/config/trace` under the hood;
  no dirty state (pure read). A "How to read the output" info
  alert demystifies the panes for first-time users.
- **Command palette** (Wave 10, `CommandPalette`) — `⌘K` /
  `Ctrl+K` opens a fuzzy-filter palette over every entry in the
  four-group IA plus shell-scope actions (Export YAML, Import
  YAML, Setup wizard, Keyboard shortcuts, Back to Browser).
  Hand-rolled scorer (substring + subsequence, <50-line
  function); combobox ARIA with `aria-controls` /
  `aria-activedescendant`; group headings ("Recent" / "Navigate"
  / "Actions") rendered non-interactively so Arrow keys skip
  over them. Recent-items MRU (last 5) persists to localStorage
  and surfaces under the "Recent" heading on empty query.
- **Shortcuts reference modal** (Wave 10, `ShortcutsHelp`) —
  `?` opens a platform-aware shortcut list. Mac users see only
  `⌘` rows; Windows / Linux users see only `Ctrl` rows — no
  duplicate "same as ⌘K on non-Apple" noise rows. Detection via
  `navigator.userAgentData.platform` with `navigator.platform`
  + UA-string fallbacks (`platform.ts`). The listener itself
  still accepts BOTH modifiers so a Mac user on a PC keyboard
  still works.
- **`⌘S` / `Ctrl+S` → Apply dirty section** (Wave 10.1, §10.3).
  `useDirtySection.ts` gains `registerApplyHandler(section, fn)`
  + `useApplyHandler(section, fn, enabled)`; handlers are
  stacked per section so the most-recently-mounted panel wins
  when siblings share a section (Wave 5 master-detail).
  `AdminPage` dispatches `⌘S` via `requestApplyCurrent(
  sectionForPath(adminPath))`; falls through to the browser
  default when no handler is registered (Diagnostics pages, no
  dirty state). Wired into Admission, Credentials & mode, and
  all five Advanced sub-panels.
- **Mobile drawer** (Wave 10.1, §10.4) — below 900px the
  persistent sidebar collapses to an AntD Drawer that slides in
  from the left. Hamburger trigger lives in the header. Drawer
  auto-closes on navigation. `useIsNarrow` hook tracks the
  breakpoint live (rotate / devtools-toggle works without
  reload).
- **i18n scaffold** (Wave 10.1, §10.2, `i18n.ts`) — pass-through
  `t(key, fallback)` helper and matching `useT()` hook. Today
  returns `fallback ?? key` — no translation tables yet.
  Purpose: when we add a locale, we swap one file's internals
  and every existing call site continues to work.
- **Audit log viewer** (Wave 11, `AuditLogPanel`) — the admin UI
  now surfaces the server's audit trail at
  `/_/admin/diagnostics/audit`. Backed by a new in-memory ring
  in `src/audit.rs` (bounded `VecDeque<AuditEntry>`; default 500
  entries; override via `DGP_AUDIT_RING_SIZE`). Every
  `audit_log()` call pushes a sanitised copy onto the ring, so
  stdout / JSON log shippers see nothing change — the ring is
  supplementary. New `GET /api/admin/audit?limit=N` endpoint
  (session-gated; not IAM-gated — all admins see the same log).
  Panel renders a monospace table with colour-coded Action tags
  (red = `login_failed` / `delete`, green = `login`, etc.),
  free-text filter across every column, optional 3-second
  auto-refresh, and an "In-memory ring — not a compliance
  substitute" banner so operators don't mistake it for durable
  storage.
- **IAM Backup import preserves `external_identities`** (post-
  manual-review hardening). `POST /api/admin/backup` used to
  silently drop every OIDC identity binding; restoring a backup
  would orphan `user_id ↔ external_sub ↔ provider_id` links and
  returning OIDC users got re-provisioned as new accounts. Import
  now remaps `user_id` + `provider_id` through the existing ID
  maps and falls back to `groups.member_ids` / autoincrement
  heuristics for legacy backups that lack a `bu.id` field. New
  optional `BackupUser.id` field in exports. Idempotent: repeat
  imports skip existing `(provider_id, external_sub)` pairs.
  `ImportResult` gains `external_identities_created` +
  `external_identities_skipped` counters.
- **GUI polish** (post-manual-review round):
  * Groups create form closes and navigates to the Edit view after
    a successful create. Previously the form stayed open with
    stale fields; "+ New" appeared broken until a page reload.
  * ExtAuth mapping-rule "+ Add Rule" flushes pending edits on
    other rules BEFORE create + reload. Previously the reload
    overwrote the in-memory rules array, silently clobbering
    unsaved typing in sibling rows.
  * New mapping rules start with an empty `match_value` and a
    placeholder hint. Previously pre-filled with `*@example.com`
    as a literal default (forcing select-all + delete before typing).
  * Users list label reflects group inheritance: `N groups
    (inherited)` or `N rules · M groups` instead of a misleading
    "No access" for users who have group-inherited permissions.

### Bug fixes / correctness

- **`DGP_BOOTSTRAP_PASSWORD` env override.** `--config <path>`
  now applies env var overrides (including
  `DGP_BOOTSTRAP_PASSWORD_HASH`) on top of the file, matching the
  behaviour of implicit search-path loading. Previously the flag
  made env vars silently ignored.
- **Admission validator** rejects reserved `public-prefix:*`
  names up front.
- **Shape classifier** explicit check-by-key-presence (flat vs.
  sectioned), so typos inside a sectioned doc report section-
  scoped errors rather than "unknown variant" from a fallback
  parse.
- **Section PUT is RFC 7396 merge-patch** (post-tag regression
  fix from live-browser verification). The first cut of
  `PUT /api/admin/config/section/:name` replaced the whole
  section — a PUT with `{max_delta_ratio: 0.42}` silently reset
  `cache_size_mb`, `listen_addr`, and `log_level` to their
  compile-time defaults. Now: present keys apply in place;
  absent keys preserve the current value; explicit `null`
  reverts to the default; array fields (e.g.
  `admission.blocks`) stay atomic. Three regression tests lock
  this in.
- **`advanced.log_level` from YAML applied at startup** (post-
  tag fix). `init_tracing` previously read only from RUST_LOG
  and DGP_LOG_LEVEL env vars, silently ignoring the YAML value;
  runtime always ran at `debug` default unless env was set.
  Now: RUST_LOG > DGP_LOG_LEVEL > config.log_level > --verbose
  > default. Env-driven deployments (Docker + K8s) keep their
  semantics exactly.
- **Legacy admin URLs canonicalise in the browser bar** (post-
  tag fix). Bookmarked v0.7.x URLs like `/_/admin/users`
  resolved correctly but left the address bar on the legacy
  form, spreading the old shape through copy/paste. A
  `useEffect` in `AdminPage` now swaps in the canonical
  hierarchical URL via `navigate(..., replace=true)` without
  adding a history entry.

### Dependencies

Frontend: `monaco-editor`, `monaco-yaml`, `react-hook-form`, `zod`,
`@hookform/resolvers`, `@dnd-kit/core` + `sortable` + `utilities`
(§4.2–§4.4). Backend: `serde_yaml`, `schemars`, `ipnet`, `globset`.

### Breaking changes

None. TOML config is deprecated but still loads; field-level
`PATCH /api/admin/config` remains the stable GUI surface; every
existing integration test passes.

### Migration

Run `deltaglider_proxy config migrate deltaglider_proxy.toml
--out deltaglider_proxy.yaml`, point the server at the YAML, and
delete the TOML when ready. No config rewrites needed on the
YAML side for existing deployments — the sectioned shape is
semantically a superset of the flat shape.

## v0.7.2

### UI Polish & Usability
- **Presigned URL duration selector**: Share button is now a split button — main button generates a 7-day link, chevron dropdown offers 1 hour, 24 hours, or 7 days. Share modal displays "Expires in" label.
- **Version display**: Sidebar branding shows the proxy version (fetched from whoami, not the unauthenticated health endpoint).
- **OAuth user identity**: Sidebar shows the user's email address (from external identity) instead of the truncated access key ID. Username displayed on its own row for readability.
- **Ant Design tooltips removed globally**: CSS nuke (`display: none !important`) on `.ant-tooltip, .ant-popover` prevents all layout-shaking tooltip bugs. All 6 `<Tooltip>` usages replaced with native `title` attributes.
- **Analytics tab padding fix**: Removed double padding (AnalyticsSection had its own wrapper padding on top of the parent MetricsPage padding). Aligned card styles (borderRadius, fontSize, fontFamily, spacing) between Monitoring and Analytics tabs.

### Correctness
- **Analytics stats**: Stats endpoint now calls `list_objects` with `metadata=true`, so delta compression savings are correctly reported (was always showing 0% savings).
- **InspectorPanel crash on zip files**: Fixed React error #310 — `useState` for share duration was declared after the early return, causing hook count mismatch.
- **Whoami returns user info**: `GET /api/whoami` now resolves the logged-in user from the session cookie (name, access_key_id, is_admin). OAuth users show their email, IAM users show their name, bootstrap shows "admin".

### Security
- **Version removed from health endpoint**: `/_/health` no longer exposes `version` field. Version is only available via the authenticated `/_/api/whoami` endpoint.

### Infrastructure
- **Docker debugging tools**: `ntpstat` and `chrony` pre-installed in the runtime image for clock skew diagnosis.

## v0.7.1

### Features
- **Bulk copy/move**: Select multiple objects and copy or move them to a different bucket/prefix via a destination picker modal. Move = copy + delete source (only after all copies succeed).
- **Bulk download as ZIP**: Select multiple files and download them as a client-side ZIP (fflate). Size warning for selections >500MB.
- **Storage analytics dashboard**: New Analytics tab in Metrics page with summary cards (total storage, space saved, savings %, estimated monthly cost savings), per-bucket stacked bar chart, session savings area chart, and compression opportunity identifier.
- **Cost configuration**: Gear icon on the monthly savings card opens a preset selector (AWS S3, S3 IA, Hetzner, Backblaze, Cloudflare R2) with localStorage persistence.
- **Themed error pages**: OAuth error pages (provider not ready, auth failed, account disabled) respect the user's dark/light theme via CSS custom properties and inline localStorage/prefers-color-scheme detection.

### UI Components
- **BulkActionBar**: Toolbar with Copy, Move, ZIP, Delete buttons — replaces the inline delete button when objects are selected.
- **DestinationPickerModal**: Bucket dropdown + prefix autocomplete, preview of destination paths, move-mode deletion warning.
- **AnalyticsSection**: Summary cards, Recharts bar/area charts, compression opportunity cards.

## v0.7.0

### Features
- **OAuth/OIDC external authentication**: Login with Google (or any OIDC provider) via the admin GUI. PKCE, state parameter, nonce, JWT validation. Per-provider configuration with display names and custom branding.
- **Group mapping rules**: Map external identity claims (email domain, email glob, email regex, claim value) to IAM groups. Rules evaluated on every OAuth login; group memberships merged (not replaced).
- **Mandatory authentication**: Proxy refuses to start without authentication credentials unless `authentication = "none"` is explicitly set. Prevents accidental open-access deployments.
- **Per-bucket compression policies**: Enable/disable compression per bucket in the Backends panel. When per-bucket compression is ON but global ratio is 0, uses 0.75 default.
- **Multi-instance config sync**: ExternalAuthManager rebuilds after S3 config sync. Stale pending OAuth flows cleared on provider rebuild.

### UI
- **OAuth login buttons**: Connect page shows branded OAuth provider buttons with "credentials instead" collapsible.
- **Authentication panel**: Full OAuth provider CRUD, mapping rules with local state + Save button (not per-keystroke API calls).
- **Backends panel**: Merged Storage + Compression tabs. Per-bucket policy toggles inline with backend configuration.
- **Custom dropdowns**: `SimpleSelect` and `SimpleAutoComplete` replace broken Ant Design Select/AutoComplete popups.
- **Tab headers**: Centered, typographically consistent headers for all admin settings tabs.
- **Object table fixes**: `showSorterTooltip={false}` prevents sort header shaking. Native `title` attributes replace broken Ant tooltips.

### Security
- **Session cookie fixes**: SameSite=Lax (not Strict) for OAuth redirect compatibility. Secure flag auto-detects TLS.
- **XSS protection**: `escape_html()` on OAuth error page parameters.
- **Rate limiting on OAuth callback**: Prevents brute-force state token guessing.
- **Group membership merge**: OAuth re-login no longer wipes existing group memberships.

### Bug Fixes
- **Bucket not loading on first click**: `s3client.setBucket()` called before React state update.
- **Empty browser after login**: `s3.reconnect()` moved to useEffect (was in Promise callback before state committed).
- **Upload SignatureDoesNotMatch**: Strip leading/trailing slashes from upload destination path.
- **InternalError hiding real errors**: Error message now shows actual error, not generic text.
- **Reference.bin fallback**: GET on aliased bucket paths falls back to passthrough when reference fetch fails.

## v0.6.0

### Features
- **Multi-backend routing**: Route different buckets to different storage backends (filesystem, S3, mixed). `RoutingBackend` implements `StorageBackend` transparently — zero engine changes, shared caches/codec/locks. Configure via `[[backends]]` TOML array or Admin GUI.
- **Backends admin panel**: New "Backends" tab in Admin Settings. Add/remove named backends, test S3 connections, set default backend. Safety checks prevent deleting in-use or default backends.
- **Bucket routing UI**: Per-bucket policy cards now show Backend + Alias fields when multi-backend is active. Route virtual bucket names to specific backends with optional real-name aliasing.
- **TOML/env config hints**: Read-only settings (Limits, Security, Advanced Compression) now show copyable `TOML:` and `ENV:` examples below each field.
- **Bucket policies promoted**: Per-Bucket Compression section moved to top of Compression tab with improved UX — contextual labels, amber tint on disabled buckets, empty state explains use cases.

### Bug Fixes
- **Dropdown positioning**: Replaced Ant Design `<Select>` with `<Radio.Group>` for backend type chooser. Fixes broken dropdown positioning at non-100% browser zoom (known `@rc-component/trigger` bug).
- **list_buckets_with_dates**: Routed virtual buckets no longer mask real creation dates with `now()`. Backends are queried first; route names added only if not already found.
- **Config validation**: `default_backend` is now validated against the `backends` list at load time. Invalid references are cleared with a warning. Bucket policy backend references are also validated.
- **S3 credential validation**: `POST /api/admin/backends` now validates credentials upfront (400) instead of failing at engine rebuild (500).
- **Taint detection**: `compute_tainted_fields` now compares `backends` and `default_backend` between runtime and disk config.

### Code Quality
- **DRY**: `BackendInfoResponse::from()` impl replaces copy-pasted conversion in two files. `rebuild_engine` made `pub(super)` and shared across config.rs and backends.rs. `DEFAULT_CONFIG_FILENAME` constant replaces 6 magic strings.
- **Dead code**: Removed inline save block from backendTab (uses shared `saveSection`). `embeddedTab` prop made required.
- **Replay window**: Hoisted duplicate `DGP_REPLAY_WINDOW_SECS` env parse to single variable.

## v0.5.11

### Features
- **Per-bucket compression**: Configure compression enable/disable and max delta ratio per bucket via TOML (`[buckets.<name>]`), admin API, or GUI. Unconfigured buckets inherit global defaults.
- **Bucket Policies GUI**: New "Bucket Policies" section in Compression tab — add, remove, edit per-bucket overrides with live save.

### Security
- **COPY source path traversal**: Reject `..` in `x-amz-copy-source` bucket and key (filesystem backend).

### Bug Fixes
- **Bucket policy hot-reload**: Fixed case normalization mismatch (config stored original case, engine expected lowercase). Added rollback on engine rebuild failure.

## v0.5.10

### UI & Documentation
- **Path-based routing**: Clean URLs (`/_/browse`, `/_/admin/users`, `/_/docs/configuration`) replace hash routing. Deep-linking to doc pages with heading anchors. Old hash bookmarks auto-redirect.
- **Embedded docs**: Full-text search (minisearch + Cmd+K), Mermaid diagram rendering with getBBox viewBox fix, Lightbox for images, landing page with screenshots and feature cards.
- **Admin GUI**: All 39 settings surfaced across 5 tabs (Backend, Compression, Limits, Security, Logging). Theme toggle in Admin/Docs header.
- **Design system**: 16 new CSS color variables for dark/light themes. Responsive breakpoints (grids collapse on mobile, panels hide).

### Correctness
- **SettingsPage**: handleSave wrapped in try-catch (prevents stuck save button on network error).
- **Multipart**: complete() no longer removes upload before store() succeeds (prevents data loss on transient failure).
- **SigV4**: Credential scope format validation in both presigned and header auth paths.
- **ListObjectsV2**: max-keys=0 returns InvalidArgument per S3 spec.
- **DocsPage**: Fixed stale useCallback dependency in handleLinkClick.

### Infrastructure
- **build.rs**: `rerun-if-changed` for dist/ directory (no more stale embedded UI assets).
- **Dead code**: Removed ApiDocsPage, BrowserConnectionCard, dead hash routes (~400 lines).
- **DRY**: FullScreenHeader shared component, FULLSCREEN_VIEWS set, dedup-by-key unified.

## v0.5.9

### Bug Fixes
- **SigV4 replay**: Fixed false positives — presigned URLs and idempotent methods (GET/HEAD) skip replay detection. Replay window reduced from 300s to 2s.
- **Logging**: SigV4 mismatch logs method, path, scope, signature prefixes. Clock skew logs direction.
- **Config DB**: Added PRAGMA busy_timeout=5000ms on open and reopen.

## v0.5.4

### Security & Hardening

- **Per-request timeout**: Added `tower_http::timeout::TimeoutLayer` returning HTTP 504 Gateway Timeout after 300s (configurable via `DGP_REQUEST_TIMEOUT_SECS`). Prevents slow clients from holding concurrency slots forever.
- **Replay cache cap**: Replay cache capped at 500K entries. If exceeded (flood attack), cache is cleared with a `SECURITY |` warning.
- **Recursive delete IAM enforcement**: Server-side recursive prefix delete (`DELETE /bucket/prefix/`) now checks per-object IAM permissions. Previously bypassed individual Deny rules.
- **Bootstrap hash format validation**: Rejects malformed bcrypt hashes at startup instead of failing silently on first auth attempt.

### Features

- **Server-side recursive delete**: `DELETE /bucket/prefix/` (trailing slash) deletes all objects under the prefix. Per-object IAM checks enforced. Filesystem backend uses native `remove_dir_all`.
- **S3 batch delete**: Batch delete (`POST /?delete`) uses `DeleteObjects` API instead of per-file DELETE for ~10x fewer API calls.
- **Base64 bootstrap password hash**: `DGP_BOOTSTRAP_PASSWORD_HASH` accepts base64-encoded bcrypt hashes to avoid `$` escaping issues in Docker/env vars. Auto-detected format.
- **Config DB resilience**: If the encrypted config DB can't be opened (wrong password, corruption), creates a fresh database instead of crashing.
- **`config_sync_bucket` in TOML**: Config DB S3 sync bucket now configurable via TOML (was env-only).

### UI

- **Favicon**: Teal chain-link icon on dark background.
- **Reduced polling**: Browser file listing polls every 30s instead of every second.

### Defaults

- **`max_delta_ratio`**: Default raised from 0.5 to 0.75 (more files stored as deltas, better space savings for typical workloads).

### Code Quality

- Removed dead `http_put` test helper from storage resilience tests.

## v0.5.3

### Performance

- **Parallel delta reconstruction**: Reference and delta fetched concurrently via `tokio::join!` instead of sequentially. Saves ~100ms per delta GET on S3 backends.
- **Parallel metadata HEAD calls**: `resolve_object_metadata` fetches delta and passthrough metadata concurrently.
- **Legacy migration off GET path**: `migrate_legacy_reference_object_if_needed` no longer runs during GET (was adding 60+ seconds of xdelta3 encoding). Available via batch migration endpoint instead.

### Correctness

- **PATHOLOGICAL warnings**: Delta and reference files missing DG metadata now log prominent warnings instead of silently falling back.
- **`dg-ref-key` → `dg-ref-path` rename**: Reference paths stored as relative paths for portable deltaspaces. Legacy `dg-ref-key` read with automatic fallback.

### Testing

- **Metadata validation tests**: 7 new tests for missing, corrupt, partial, and wrong metadata scenarios.

### UI

- **Connect page simplification**: Shows only relevant fields per auth mode (bootstrap password OR S3 credentials, not both). Removed endpoint URL field (derived from window location).

## v0.5.2

### Correctness (Critical)

- **Fix GET on rclone-copied delta files**: `retrieve_stream` used `obj_key.filename` instead of `metadata.original_name` for storage lookups, causing 404 on files whose S3 key had a `.delta` suffix. This bug was not caught by 222 tests because they all follow the clean PUT→GET path.

### Testing

- **Storage resilience tests**: 6 new adversarial tests that would have caught the above bug:
  - Triangle invariant (LIST→HEAD→GET must all succeed for every key)
  - HEAD/GET content-length consistency
  - SHA256 roundtrip verification across all storage strategies
  - Unmanaged file triangle invariant (directly placed files)
  - External delete → 404 (not stale cached data)
  - LIST never exposes `.delta` suffix or `reference.bin`

### Security

- **Session cookie hardening**: Secure, HttpOnly, SameSite=Strict attributes.
- **Remove secrets from whoami**: `/whoami` endpoint no longer exposes secret access keys.
- **Cleanup `.bak` files**: Removed leftover backup files from refactoring.

## v0.5.1

### Security Fixes (Post-Release Audit)

- **Deny condition bypass**: Fixed condition evaluation that could skip Deny rules under certain group membership combinations.
- **Group `member_ids` persistence**: Group member lists were not persisted correctly to SQLCipher DB.
- **`evaluate_iam` alternate path**: Fixed edge case where IAM evaluation took a non-standard code path.
- **Session storage**: Server-side session storage for S3 credentials (no longer stored client-side).
- **`env_clear()` on subprocess**: xdelta3 subprocess environment cleared to prevent credential leaks.
- **`DGP_TRUST_PROXY_HEADERS`**: Default changed to `true` for reverse proxy deployments.

### Testing

- **Auth integration tests**: SigV4 signature verification, presigned URLs, clock skew rejection, IAM lifecycle.
- **IAM persona tests**: 23 tests for groups, ListBuckets filtering, prefix scoping, conditions.

### Infrastructure

- **Docker retry**: `apt-get` retries on network blips (`Acquire::Retries=3`).
- **Startup refactor**: Extracted `startup.rs` from `main.rs`, split `engine.rs` and `config_db.rs` into sub-modules.

## v0.5.0

### IAM Policy Conditions (iam-rs)

- **Full AWS IAM condition support**: Integrated `iam-rs` crate for standards-compliant policy evaluation with all AWS condition operators (StringEquals, StringLike, IpAddress, NumericLessThan, etc.).
- **`s3:prefix` condition**: Deny LIST requests based on the prefix query parameter. Example: `{"StringLike": {"s3:prefix": ".*"}}` blocks listing dotfiles.
- **`aws:SourceIp` condition**: Restrict operations to specific IP ranges. Example: `{"IpAddress": {"aws:SourceIp": "10.0.0.0/8"}}`.
- **DB schema v4**: New `conditions_json` column on permissions and group_permissions tables. Backward compatible — existing permissions work unchanged.
- **Permission validation**: Effect normalization (case-insensitive), max 100 rules per user/group, resource pattern validation (trailing wildcard only), `$`-prefix names blocked.
- **Frontend conditions UI**: Collapsible conditions section per permission rule with prefix and IP restriction inputs.

### IAM Module Refactor

- **Split `iam.rs` into module**: `iam/types.rs`, `iam/permissions.rs`, `iam/middleware.rs`, `iam/keygen.rs`, `iam/mod.rs`. Pure permission evaluation logic separated from framework-specific middleware.
- **Centralized permission authority**: All permission checks go through `AuthenticatedUser.can()`, `.can_with_context()`, `.can_see_bucket()`, `.is_admin()`.
- **Legacy admin as AuthenticatedUser**: Bootstrap credentials now create a `$bootstrap` AuthenticatedUser with wildcard permissions instead of bypassing authorization entirely.
- **Groups loaded on startup**: Previously groups were only loaded on first IAM mutation.
- **ListBuckets per-user filtering**: Users see only buckets they have permissions on.
- **IAM backup/restore**: Export/import all users, groups, permissions, and credentials as JSON via `/_/api/admin/backup`.

### Security Fixes

- **Batch delete per-key authorization**: Previously the middleware only checked delete permission at bucket level; now each key in a batch delete is individually authorized.
- **Progressive auth delay**: Failed auth attempts trigger exponential backoff (100ms→5s), making brute force expensive before lockout.
- **Attack detection logging**: `SECURITY |` log events for brute force detection, lockout, and repeated failures with IP and attempt count.
- **Condition parse fail-closed**: Malformed conditions produce an empty policy (deny-all) instead of stripping conditions (fail-open).
- **Error XML escaping**: Error `<Message>` now XML-escaped to prevent malformed responses.
- **Bucket names with dots**: S3-compliant validation now accepts dots in bucket names.
- **is_admin strict check**: Uses `== "Allow"` instead of `!= "Deny"`.

### Performance

- **Range passthrough**: Range requests on passthrough objects pass the Range header through to upstream S3 (or seek on filesystem) instead of buffering the entire file. A 1KB range on a 100MB file reads only 1KB from storage.
- **Request concurrency limit**: `tower::limit::ConcurrencyLimitLayer` with configurable max (default 1024, `DGP_MAX_CONCURRENT_REQUESTS`).
- **Write-before-delete**: Storage strategy transitions (delta↔passthrough) now write the new variant before deleting the old one, preventing transient 404s on concurrent GETs.
- **Prefix lock cleanup**: `cleanup_prefix_locks()` runs on every lock acquisition instead of only on delete.
- **Interleave-and-paginate dedup**: Shared function for the interleave/sort/paginate pattern used by engine, S3 backend, and filesystem backend.

### Unified Audit Logging

- **`src/audit.rs`**: Single audit module with `sanitize()`, `extract_client_info()`, and `audit_log()`. Eliminates duplicated sanitization and IP extraction across handlers and admin API.
- **Session TTL decoupled**: `SessionStore::ttl()` method replaces re-parsing `DGP_SESSION_TTL_HOURS` in the cookie formatter.

### Frontend

- **Conditions UI**: Permission editor supports prefix restriction and IP restriction inputs with collapsible conditions panel per rule.
- **IAM backup buttons**: Export/Import buttons in admin sidebar for JSON backup/restore.
- **Log level radio buttons**: Replaced broken Select dropdown with Radio.Group.
- **Polling fix**: Users/Groups panels load once on mount instead of re-polling on every render.
- **Deduplicated formatters**: Unified byte formatters, extracted CredentialsBanner and InspectorSection components.

### Tests

- **222 tests**: 180 unit + 42 integration (23 new persona tests covering groups, ListBuckets filtering, prefix scoping, cross-user isolation, multipart, content verification, deny-from-groups, IAM conditions).
- **iam-rs condition tests**: Unit tests for prefix deny with StringLike, IP deny with IpAddress.

### Metadata Cache

- **In-memory metadata cache**: New moka-based cache (`MetadataCache` in `metadata_cache.rs`) eliminates redundant HEAD calls for object metadata. 50 MB default budget (~125K–150K entries), 10-minute TTL. Populated on PUT, HEAD, and LIST+metadata=true. Consulted on HEAD, GET, and LIST (including for file_size correction on delta-compressed objects). Invalidated on DELETE and prefix delete. Configurable via `DGP_METADATA_CACHE_MB` env var or `metadata_cache_mb` TOML setting.

### Security Hardening

#### Tier 1 — Authentication & Session Security
- **Rate limiting**: Per-IP token bucket rate limiter on auth endpoints — 5 attempts per 15-minute window, 30-minute lockout after exhaustion. Prevents brute-force attacks on admin login.
- **Session IP binding**: Admin sessions are bound to the originating IP address. Requests from a different IP are rejected even with a valid session token.
- **Session concurrency cap**: Maximum 10 concurrent admin sessions. Oldest session evicted when the limit is reached.
- **Configurable session TTL**: Default reduced from 24h to 4h. Override with `DGP_SESSION_TTL_HOURS`.
- **Password quality enforcement**: Min 12 chars, max 128 chars, common password blocklist. Validated on both admin API and CLI password set flows.
- **SigV4 replay detection**: Duplicate signatures within a 5-second window are rejected to prevent request replay attacks.
- **Presigned URL max expiry**: Capped at 7 days (604,800 seconds), matching AWS S3.
- **Configurable clock skew**: `DGP_CLOCK_SKEW_SECONDS` (default 300s) controls SigV4 timestamp tolerance.

#### Tier 2 — Response Hardening & Anti-Fingerprinting
- **Security response headers**: All responses include `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff` and `X-Frame-Options: DENY`. HSTS header added when TLS is enabled.
- **Anti-fingerprinting**: Debug/fingerprinting headers (`Server`, `x-amz-storage-type`, `x-deltaglider-cache`) suppressed by default. Enable with `DGP_DEBUG_HEADERS=true`.
- **Bootstrap password TTY safety**: Auto-generated bootstrap password displayed in plaintext only when stderr is a TTY. Hidden in container/CI/piped output to prevent credential leaks in log aggregators.
- **Multipart upload limits**: Concurrent multipart uploads capped at 100 (configurable via `DGP_MAX_MULTIPART_UPLOADS`) to prevent resource exhaustion.

### Usage Scanner

- **Background prefix size scanner**: `/_/api/admin/usage` endpoint computes prefix sizes asynchronously with 5-minute cached results, 1,000-entry LRU cache, and 100K-object scan cap per prefix.

## v0.4.0

### Single-Port Architecture

- **UI served at `/_/`**: The embedded admin UI and all admin APIs are now served under `/_/` on the same port as the S3 API. No more separate port (was port+1). The `/_/` prefix is safe because `_` is not a valid S3 bucket name character. Health, stats, and metrics endpoints are available at both root (`/health`) and under `/_/` (`/_/health`).

### IAM & Authentication

- **Bootstrap password**: Renamed from "admin password". A single infrastructure secret that encrypts the SQLCipher config DB, signs admin session cookies, and gates admin GUI access in bootstrap mode. Auto-generated on first run. Backward-compatible aliases (`DGP_ADMIN_PASSWORD_HASH`, `--set-admin-password`) still work.
- **Multi-user IAM (ABAC)**: Per-user credentials stored in encrypted SQLCipher database (`deltaglider_config.db`). Each user has access key, secret key, and permission rules with actions (`read`, `write`, `delete`, `list`, `admin`, `*`) and resource patterns (`bucket/*`). Admin = wildcard actions AND wildcard resources.
- **IAM mode auto-activation**: When the first IAM user is created, the proxy switches from bootstrap mode to IAM mode. Bootstrap credentials are migrated as "legacy-admin" user. Admin GUI access becomes permission-based (no password needed for IAM admins).
- **Admin API**: `/_/api/admin/users` CRUD, `/_/api/admin/users/:id/rotate-keys`, `/_/whoami`, `/_/api/admin/login-as` for IAM user impersonation.

### S3 API Compatibility

- **Range requests**: `Range` header support with 206 Partial Content responses, `Accept-Ranges: bytes` header on all object responses.
- **Conditional headers**: `If-Match` / `If-Unmodified-Since` (412 Precondition Failed), `If-None-Match` / `If-Modified-Since` (304 Not Modified).
- **Content-MD5 validation**: Validates `Content-MD5` header on PUT and UploadPart, rejects with 400 on mismatch.
- **Copy metadata directive**: `x-amz-metadata-directive: COPY` (default) or `REPLACE` on CopyObject.
- **ACL stubs**: GET/PUT `?acl` accepted and ignored for SDK compatibility.
- **Response header overrides**: `response-content-type`, `response-content-disposition`, `response-content-encoding`, `response-content-language`, `response-expires` query parameters on GET.
- **Per-request UUIDs**: `x-amz-request-id` header with unique UUID on every response.
- **Bucket naming validation**: Extracted `ValidatedBucket` and `ValidatedPath` extractors for automatic S3 path validation.
- **ListObjectsV2 improvements**: `start-after` parameter, `encoding-type` passthrough, `fetch-owner` support, base64 continuation tokens, max-keys capped at 1000.
- **Real creation dates**: `ListBuckets` returns actual bucket creation timestamps.

### Performance

- **Lite LIST optimization**: LIST operations no longer issue per-object HEAD calls. Sizes shown are stored (compressed) sizes. ~8x faster for large listings.
- **FS delimiter optimization**: `list_objects_delegated()` for filesystem backend uses a single `read_dir` at the prefix directory instead of a recursive walk when a delimiter is specified. Dramatically faster for buckets with many prefixes.

### Security

- **OsRng for tokens**: Session tokens and IAM access keys use `OsRng` (cryptographically secure) instead of `thread_rng`.
- **DB rekey verification**: Bootstrap password changes verify the new key can open the database before committing.
- **Proper transactions**: IAM user creation uses database transactions for atomicity.

### Code Quality

- **`S3Op` enum** (`storage/s3.rs`): Operation context for S3 error classification, replacing string-based operation names.
- **Session cookie helpers** (`session.rs`): Extracted session store into its own module with `OsRng` token generation.
- **`env_parse()` DRY** (`config.rs`): Extracted environment variable parsing boilerplate into reusable helpers.
- **Dead code cleanup**: Removed `AdminGate`, unused `#/settings` route, dead `UsersTab` and `UserModal` components.

### UI Features

- **File preview**: Double-click on any previewable file (text, images) to view inline via the inspector panel. Tooltip indicates previewable files.
- **Show/hide system files**: Toggle to show or hide DeltaGlider internal files (`.dg/` directory contents) in the object browser.
- **Folder size computation**: Folder sizes computed and displayed in the object table.
- **Delete user confirmation**: User deletion requires `window.confirm` dialog.
- **Full-screen admin overlay**: Admin settings now use a full-screen overlay with master-detail layout for user management.
- **Interactive API reference**: New `#/docs` page with interactive API documentation.
- **Key rotation safety**: Prevents self-lockout on key rotation; changing only the secret key no longer regenerates the access key.
- **Credentials display**: After creating a user, shows only the credentials with a dismissible banner before returning to the user list.

## v0.3.0

### S3-Compatible Endpoint Support

- **Disabled automatic request/response checksums**: AWS SDK for Rust (like boto3 1.36+) adds CRC32/CRC64 checksum headers by default. S3-compatible stores (Hetzner Object Storage, Backblaze B2, some MinIO configs) reject these with BadRequest. Now sets both `request_checksum_calculation` and `response_checksum_validation` to `WhenRequired`. (Port of Python DeltaGlider [6.1.1] fix.)
- **Retry with exponential backoff on PUT**: Hetzner returns transient 400 BadRequest errors (~1-2% of requests) with `connection: close` and no request-id. PUT operations now retry on 400 and 503 with 100/200/400ms backoff (3 retries). Also retries on network/timeout errors.
- **Verbose S3 error logging**: Every S3 error now logs operation, bucket, HTTP status code, `x-amz-request-id`, and full error details for production debugging.

### Unmanaged Object Support (Fixes #3, #4)

Objects that exist on the backend storage but were never stored through the proxy (no DeltaGlider metadata) are now fully accessible:

- **S3 backend**: HEAD, GET, and LIST now return fallback metadata from the S3 HEAD response (size, ETag, Last-Modified) instead of 404
- **Filesystem backend**: HEAD, GET, and LIST now return fallback metadata from filesystem stats (size, mtime) instead of 404
- **HEAD/GET consistency**: Both operations return metadata from the same source, ensuring consistent Content-Length and ETag
- **Delta and reference files**: Fallback metadata also works for delta/reference files without metadata (xattr or S3 headers)
- **Corrupt metadata recovery**: S3 objects with partial/corrupt DG headers now fall back to passthrough instead of hard-failing

### Error Handling Hardening

- **Error discrimination**: Replaced blanket `.ok()` and `map_err(|_| NotFound)` patterns with explicit error matching throughout the engine. `NotFound` → expected (object doesn't exist), `Io` → warn + retry path (concurrent access), other errors → propagate as 500
- **ENOENT classification**: `io_to_storage_error()` now maps file-not-found I/O errors to `StorageError::NotFound` instead of `StorageError::Io`, preventing false 500s for missing files
- **Filesystem xattr errors**: Only fall back to filesystem stats on `NotFound`; permission denied and other I/O errors are now propagated instead of silently swallowed
- **Reference cache errors**: `get_reference_cached()` now discriminates `NotFound` (→ MissingReference) from other storage errors (→ Storage)

### Security

- **SigV4 clock skew validation**: Regular (non-presigned) SigV4 requests now enforce a 15-minute clock skew window, matching AWS S3 behavior. Prevents replay attacks with arbitrarily old timestamps. Returns new `RequestTimeTooSkewed` error (403).
- **Reserved filename validation**: PUT requests for `reference.bin` and `*.delta` keys are rejected with 400 to prevent collision with internal storage files

### Reliability

- **Codec subprocess timeout**: xdelta3 subprocess now has a 5-minute timeout via `try_wait` polling loop. Kills hung processes and returns an error instead of blocking indefinitely.
- **Copy object size check**: `copy_object` now verifies actual data size after retrieval, catching cases where fallback metadata reports `file_size=0` that would bypass the pre-copy size check
- **S3 metadata size validation**: Rejects PUT if DeltaGlider metadata headers exceed S3's 2KB limit, instead of letting the upstream S3 return an opaque 400
- **Config validation**: Warns on `max_delta_ratio` outside [0.0, 1.0] and `max_object_size=0` at startup
- **Cache invalidation ordering**: Reference is now deleted from storage BEFORE cache invalidation, preventing concurrent GET from re-caching a stale reference between invalidation and deletion. Fixed in 3 code paths (passthrough fallback, deltaspace cleanup, legacy migration).

### DRY Cleanup

- **`FileMetadata::fallback()`**: New constructor consolidates 4 duplicate fallback metadata construction sites across S3 and filesystem backends
- **`Engine::validated_key()`**: Extracts the 5x repeated `ObjectKey::parse + validate_object + deltaspace_id` pattern
- **`try_unmanaged_passthrough()`**: Extracted 60-line nested match block from `retrieve_stream()` into a focused helper with flat control flow

### Testing

- 26 new tests (244 total, up from 218): unmanaged object operations, HEAD/GET metadata consistency, reserved filename rejection, copy with unmanaged sources, error discrimination (`io_to_storage_error` unit tests), delta byte-level round-trip integrity, multipart ETag format, user metadata round-trip, external file deletion → 404

### Infrastructure

- Docker build: native ARM64 on Blacksmith runners (no QEMU), cargo-chef for dep caching — ~5x faster builds
- RustSec: updated deps to fix 6 advisories in aws-lc-sys and rustls-webpki

## v0.2.0

### Cache Health Observability

Four layers of defense against silent cache degradation:

- **Startup warnings**: `[cache]` log prefix warns when cache is disabled (0 MB) or undersized (<1024 MB)
- **Periodic monitor**: Every 60s, warns on >90% utilization or >50% miss rate
- **Prometheus metrics**: `cache_max_bytes`, `cache_utilization_ratio`, `cache_miss_rate_ratio` — computed on scrape from existing atomic counters
- **Response header**: `x-deltaglider-cache: hit|miss` on delta-reconstructed GETs
- **Health endpoint**: `/health` now includes `cache_size_bytes`, `cache_max_bytes`, `cache_entries`, `cache_utilization_pct`

### Proxy Dashboard

Full Prometheus metrics dashboard in the built-in React UI (`#/metrics`):

- Top KPIs: uptime, peak memory, total requests, storage savings %
- Cache section: utilization gauge, hit rate with color coding, live hits vs misses chart
- Delta compression: encode/decode latency, compression ratio distribution, storage decisions
- HTTP traffic: operation breakdown (bar + donut chart), latency distribution, status codes, live request rate
- Authentication: success/failure counts with failure reason breakdown
- Auto-refresh every 5s, storage stats every 60s

### Correctness Fixes (11 bugs)

- **Codec stderr deadlock**: xdelta3 stderr was piped but only drained after stdout. If xdelta3 writes >64KB to stderr, stdout reader blocks forever. Now drains all 3 pipes concurrently.
- **Filesystem metadata-data split-brain**: Crash between `atomic_write` and `xattr_meta::write_metadata` left files without metadata. Now writes xattr to temp file before rename — atomic visibility.
- **Auth exemption path normalization**: `/health/` (trailing slash) was not matched by the exact-string exemption. Now strips trailing slashes.
- **SigV4 presigned URL case-sensitivity**: `x-amz-signature` (lowercase) was not excluded from canonical query string. Now uses case-insensitive comparison.
- **Stats cache thundering herd**: Lock released before `compute_stats`, so N concurrent requests all scanned storage. Now holds `tokio::sync::Mutex` across the async compute.
- **Multipart double-completion race**: Two concurrent `CompleteMultipartUpload` calls both read parts under read lock, both stored data. Now takes ownership under write lock atomically.
- **Multipart write lock starvation**: Assembly of large uploads held write lock during memcpy of all parts. Now removes upload from map (fast), releases lock, then assembles.
- **AWS chunked truncated payload**: Decoded length mismatch with `x-amz-decoded-content-length` was logged but data stored anyway. Now rejects with 400.
- **Admin config rollback**: Backend config was committed before engine swap. If `DynEngine::new()` failed, config showed new backend but engine was old. Now rolls back on failure.
- **S3 403 misclassification**: All 403 errors mapped to `BucketNotFound`. Now only maps for bucket-level operations; object-level 403 is reported as S3 error.
- **list_objects max_keys=0**: Produced `is_truncated=true` with no continuation token. Now clamps to >= 1.

### DRY & Code Quality

- **`StoreContext` parameter object**: Eliminated 3 `#[allow(clippy::too_many_arguments)]` suppressions from `encode_and_store`, `store_passthrough`, `set_reference_baseline`
- **`with_metrics()` helper**: Collapsed 8 inline `if let Some(m) = &self.metrics` blocks to one-liners
- **`try_acquire_codec()`**: Extracted codec semaphore acquisition with consistent error message
- **`cache_key()`**: Extracted `format!("{}/{}", bucket, deltaspace_id)` used 5 times
- **`delete_delta_idempotent()` / `delete_passthrough_idempotent()`**: Extracted 5 verbose `delete_ignoring_not_found` call sites
- **`paginate_sorted()`**: Extracted duplicated pagination logic from `list_objects`
- **`pipe_stdin_stdout_stderr()`**: Extracted duplicated codec pipe coordination from encode/decode
- **`object_url()`**: Extracted test helper URL construction
- **`parse_env()` / `parse_env_opt()`**: Extracted config env var parsing boilerplate
- **`header_value()`**: Renamed from cryptic `hval()`
- **`_guard`**: Renamed from misleading `_lock` (the Drop impl is load-bearing)
- Trimmed verbose `PERF:` archaeology comments — kept constraints, removed history
- Removed `Option<Arc<Metrics>>` from `AppState` — metrics are always present, eliminated branch per request
- Replaced `format!("%{:02X}")` with `write!()` in SigV4 URI encoding — no heap allocation per encoded byte

### Infrastructure

- `/stats` endpoint: 10s server-side cache, capped at 1,000 objects with `truncated` indicator
- `/health`, `/stats`, `/metrics` exempted from SigV4 authentication
- Demo server exposes `/health`, `/stats`, `/metrics` alongside admin API
- `prefixed_key()` helper in S3 backend eliminates 3x prefix if/else duplication

## v0.1.9

Initial public release with S3-compatible proxy, delta compression, filesystem and S3 backends, SigV4 authentication, multipart uploads, embedded React UI, and Prometheus metrics.
