//! S3 API request handlers (shared state + helpers).
//!
//! With the legacy axum-handler S3 path retired, the only S3
//! implementation is `src/s3_adapter_s3s.rs` (the `s3s` crate
//! adapter). This module now hosts only:
//!
//! - `AppState` — shared application state for both the s3s adapter
//!   and the admin API.
//! - `form_post` — the browser form-POST upload path. Lives outside
//!   the s3s crate because s3s doesn't model the multipart/form-data
//!   PostObject shape; the s3s router intercepts that one request
//!   shape and hands it to `form_post::handle_form_post_upload`.
//! - `object_helpers` — small shared helpers (the quota gate + the
//!   per-object event-outbox enqueue), called from both
//!   `s3_adapter_s3s` and `form_post`.
//! - `status` — `/_/health` and `/_/stats` legacy endpoints.
//! - `ensure_bucket_exists`, `debug_headers_enabled`, `audit_log_s3` —
//!   small free helpers reused by the surviving handlers.
//!
//! Pre-consolidation, this module also hosted ~3500 LOC of axum-based
//! S3 handlers (object, bucket, multipart). Those moved into the
//! s3s adapter; the old files are gone.

///    `require_bucket_exists` check too, so the contract is enforced at
