//! Audit logging helpers for security compliance.
//!
//! Provides a single `audit_log` function used by both S3 handlers and admin API
//! for structured audit log output.
//!
//! ## In-memory ring buffer (Wave 11)
//!
//! Every `audit_log()` call ALSO pushes a structured `AuditEntry` onto a
//! process-local ring buffer. The admin GUI's Diagnostics → Audit page
//! reads this via `GET /api/admin/audit`. The ring is bounded
//! (default 500 entries; override via `DGP_AUDIT_RING_SIZE`) so memory
//! stays flat under high traffic — older entries fall off the back.
//!
//! The ring is supplementary — the underlying `tracing::info!` call
//! still fires so operators grepping stdout / JSON logs in production
//! see nothing change. The ring is strictly a UX convenience for the
//! admin panel, not a compliance substitute.
