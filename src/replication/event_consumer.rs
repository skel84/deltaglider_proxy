//! Event-driven replication consumer.
//!
//! Replication is **event-driven**: object mutations (PUT/DELETE/COPY/
//! CompleteMultipartUpload) are appended to the durable `event_outbox` by the
//! S3 write path, and this consumer drains them in near-real time, fanning each
//! object out to the replication rules whose `source` matches. A slow per-rule
//! full reconcile (`worker::run_rule`, default 24h) is the self-healing safety
//! net — events are the primary trigger.
//!
//! ## Pub/sub via a per-listener cursor
//!
//! The outbox is append-only. Each independent listener (webhook delivery and
//! replication) keeps its OWN high-water `last_event_id` in `listener_cursors`
//! and reads `WHERE id > cursor`. The two listeners never contend on a shared
//! status column. Ordering is by the autoincrement `id` (the true arrival
//! order) — NOT `occurred_at`, which is wall-clock and can tie or regress.
//!
//! ## Per-key compaction
//!
//! Before acting, the consumer collapses all pending events for a single
//! `(bucket, key)` into ONE *liveness* verdict (Copy / Delete / Noop) via
//! [`compact_key_events`] — so create+modify+delete within one drain is a
//! single net action, not three. The actual Copy-vs-skip / Delete-vs-noop
//! idempotency is then the planner's job (`should_replicate` + a dest HEAD),
//! keeping the decision logic in exactly one place shared with reconcile.
//!
//! This module hosts the PURE helpers (filtering, compaction, routing); they
//! are unit-tested without any I/O. The background loop is `spawn_event_consumer`.
