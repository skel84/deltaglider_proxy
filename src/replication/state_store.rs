//! Persistent state for replication — wraps the v6 SQLCipher tables:
//!
//! - `replication_state`: one row per rule. Current scheduling state,
//!   pause flag, leader lease, continuation token. Keyed by rule name.
//! - `replication_run_history`: one row per completed or in-progress
//!   run. Append-only; the worker inserts on begin, updates on finish.
//! - `replication_failures`: per-object errors. Ring-bounded per
//!   `record_failure`'s `max_retained`.
//!
//! Implemented as methods on [`ConfigDb`] so the SQLCipher mutex (held
//! at the type boundary) serialises all replication state mutations
//! alongside IAM mutations. Matches the pattern in
//! `src/config_db/users.rs`.
