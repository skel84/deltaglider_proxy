//! CLI subcommands for the `deltaglider_proxy` binary.

//! Top-level shape: `deltaglider_proxy <subcommand> [args...]`.
//!
//! Each subcommand is a small dispatcher that borrows logic from the library
//! crate. The `config` and `admission` families live in `config.rs`; the
//! AWS-CLI-shaped S3 commands (`cp`, `ls`, `rm`, `stats`, `verify`) each get
//! their own module so help-text and argument shapes don't collide.
