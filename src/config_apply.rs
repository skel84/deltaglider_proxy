//! Config mutation seam for BACKGROUND tasks.
//!
//! The admin API mutates config inside its handlers (where it has
//! `AdminState`); background workers — today, migrate jobs that stage a
//! transient route and flip a bucket's backend — need the same
//! "mutate → rebuild engine → persist" transaction without `AdminState`.
//! Verified: the engine rebuild needs only `AppState.engine` +
//! `AppState.metrics`, so this seam carries `Arc<AppState>` and the
//! resolved config-file path (the SAME path the admin API persists to —
//! resolved once in main and shared, never re-derived, so a worker can't
//! write to a different file than the operator's apply does).
//!
//! NOTE: `mutate_and_apply` deliberately does NOT rebuild the
//! bucket-derived snapshots (public-prefix / admission). That matches the
//! synchronous migrate flow it replaces; `__dgmigrate_*` transient
//! policies carry no public prefixes or admission rules, and the final
//! flip only changes `backend` routing — none of which feed those
//! snapshots.
