/**
 * Pure storage-section PUT payload builder for per-backend encryption
 * changes (extracted from BackendsPanel.handleEncryptionApply).
 *
 * Lives in its own React/antd-free module so the Node regression script
 * can transpile-and-import it and assert the wire body byte-for-byte —
 * this is the one genuinely-pure decision point in BackendsPanel, and
 * the composed body is exactly what the admin API receives, so it must
 * never drift.
 *
 * Composes a `storage` section-PUT body that mutates ONLY the target
 * backend's `encryption` block and leaves every sibling backend + every
 * non-encryption field untouched. The server's RFC 7396 merge-patch
 * semantics guarantee siblings are preserved — we just need to send the
 * correct shape for the path we want to replace.
 *
 * Path:
 *   * Singleton (synthetic "default" backend surfaced by the server when
 *     `backends` is empty) → `{ backend_encryption: <patch> }`.
 *   * Named entry (any other name) → `{ backends: [{name, type, ...,
 *     encryption}] }`. The server replaces `backends` as a whole array
 *     on a section PUT; for per-entry edits we send the FULL list with
 *     only the target entry's `encryption` swapped.
