// Single source of truth for delta-compression savings math on the
// client. Mirrors the Rust module at `src/deltaglider/savings.rs`.
//
// Why this file exists: pre-centralisation the SPA had THREE inline
// "savings" formulas (DeltaSavingsChip, useUploadQueue, InspectorPanel),
// each rolling their own cap (99 in one, 99.9 in two others) and their
// own zero-bytes edge handling. The result was that the same "100%
// saved" lie or "−12% saved" looked different in each surface. Every
// number a user reads must come from one of the two helpers below.
//
// Server-driven numbers (per-prefix / per-bucket) should arrive
// pre-computed in `PrefixSavingsResponse` from `/_/api/admin/...`. The
// helpers here handle the per-object / per-batch cases where the
// browser computes locally because it already has both sides
// (originalSize + storedSize). They MUST NOT be used to roll up a
// prefix client-side — see `getPrefixSavings` for that.

/**
 * Per-scope savings summary (suitable for "we just saved you ~X%").
 * Capped at 99 so the UI never reads "100% saved" while bytes are on
 * disk; clamped to 0 on the negative side (a single delta against a
 * larger reference can produce a negative diff, but end-user surfaces
 * should show "no savings yet", not "−12%"). The diagnostic admin
 * surfaces have their own server-computed signed `true_savings_bytes`
 * / `compression_ratio` fields when they need to show the negative.
