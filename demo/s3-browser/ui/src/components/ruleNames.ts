 * Pure rule-name helper shared by the Lifecycle and Replication payload

 *
 * React-free (no antd / no hooks) so the Node regression script can
 * transpile-and-import it directly. Both panels seed a new draft rule with
 * a `<base>-<n>` name and bump `n` until it does not collide with an
 * existing rule name — this collapses that loop into one tested helper.
 */

 * Return the first `<base>-<n>` name (n starting at `existing.length + 1`)
 * that is not already used by a rule in `existing`. Matches the historical
 * per-panel loop exactly: it starts at the count + 1 and increments until
 * the name is free, so a freshly-added rule on a list of N gets `<base>-(N+1)`
 * unless that collides.
