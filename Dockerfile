# Cargo.toml is the single source of truth for the version string.
# vite.config.ts reads it at build time to embed __BUILD_VERSION__ into
# the bundle (see `resolveBuildVersion()` there). Copying it here also
# doubles as a cache key: a version bump invalidates this layer and
# forces `npm run build` to run — which re-evaluates `new Date()` in
# the vite define, so __BUILD_TIME__ stays honest across version bumps
# instead of freezing at the first-ever-built timestamp.

# ── Build stage: Rust ──
# Pin the Rust toolchain (the floating `rust:1-bookworm` tag drifts and has
# caused reproducibility breaks). NOTE: we deliberately do NOT use cargo-chef
# here — cargo-chef 0.1.77's prepare/cook round-trip writes a recipe whose
# auto-discovered targets carry a target-level `edition`, which modern `cargo
# build` rejects as a hard error ("failed to parse manifest"), breaking the
# image build on every recent Rust. A plain single-stage build is correct and
# robust; dependency compilation is cached by buildx's GHA layer cache across
# release runs, so the lost cargo-chef dep-layer is not a meaningful regression.

# ── Runtime ──
# Security notes:
# - Runs as non-root user 'dg' (least privilege).
# - Only ca-certificates, xdelta3, and curl are installed (minimal attack surface).
#   curl is required for the HEALTHCHECK probe; no shell utilities beyond busybox.
# - No secrets are embedded in the image — all credentials are provided at runtime
#   via environment variables or mounted config files.
#
# Kubernetes / container orchestrator hardening (apply in your deployment manifest):
#   securityContext:
#     runAsNonRoot: true
#     readOnlyRootFilesystem: true
#     allowPrivilegeEscalation: false
#     capabilities:
#       drop: [ALL]
#   # Mount a writable volume for the config DB and data directory:
#   volumeMounts:
#     - name: data
#       mountPath: /data
#     - name: tmp
#       mountPath: /tmp
