# About jobs, write gates, and durability

DeltaGlider Proxy runs four kinds of background work — replication rules, lifecycle rules, bucket re-encryption, and bucket migration — and presents all of them on one surface. This page explains why that's one surface and not four, why some jobs deliberately block writes, and what "durable" actually means here.

## One surface for four kinds

The operator's mental model should be: *anything that runs in the background is a job, and every job has runs, failures, and actions.* Whether Acme is mirroring `releases` to `aws-dr`, expiring `db-archive` dumps after 90 days, or re-encrypting a bucket after a key change, the questions are identical — is it running, when did it last run, what failed, can I pause it? Four bespoke screens would mean four places to look during an incident, and four slightly different vocabularies for "it's stuck." So there's one jobs list, one runs/failures drawer, and a per-kind capability matrix (you can pause a rule but not a migration; you can cancel a migration but not a rule) rather than four APIs.

## Rules vs one-offs

Two shapes exist because the work is genuinely two-shaped. **Rules** — replication and lifecycle — are recurring policy: they belong in YAML, reviewed in git, identical across replicas, with runtime state (cursors, pause flags, run history) kept separately in the config DB so a config reload doesn't forget what's been done. **One-offs** — re-encrypt and migrate — are born from an operator action, not a policy file; they're created via API or GUI, live entirely in the DB, and *are* their own single run. Forcing a migration into YAML would mean committing a file to express "do this once, now"; forcing replication into the DB would hide standing policy from code review. Each shape lives where its authorship lives.

## Why maintenance jobs take a write gate

While a re-encrypt or migrate job works a bucket, S3 writes to that bucket get `503 SlowDown`; reads pass untouched. This is consistency chosen over availability, deliberately.

Consider the race the gate prevents: a re-encrypt job is sweeping `db-archive` after a key rotation while `backup-bot` PUTs tonight's dump. Without the gate, that PUT can land under the old configuration *after* the sweep has passed its key — and the job finishes "successfully" with one object silently stranded under a key you're about to retire. A migration has the same race with a worse ending: a write to the old backend after the copy phase simply vanishes when traffic flips.

`503 SlowDown` is the honest trade because it's a *protocol-native* refusal: AWS SDKs back off and retry automatically, so `backup-bot` doesn't fail — it waits. The gate engages at job creation (no window between deciding and claiming), drains in-flight writes before copying, and lifts the moment a migration flips routing — before optional source cleanup, so the unavailability window is the copy, not the cleanup.

This is also the place to mention **soft quotas**, which sit at the opposite end of the same trade. Bucket quotas read from a usage scanner whose results are cached for five minutes, so a burst of concurrent writes can overshoot the limit by a few minutes of throughput. Quotas are soft because making them hard would put a synchronous full-bucket size check on every PUT — paying a heavy tax on the hot path to enforce a budget number. Where the write gate buys strict consistency with temporary unavailability, soft quotas buy hot-path speed with approximate enforcement. If you need a hard cap, enforce it at the storage provider.

## What "durable" means here

Every job survives a proxy restart, and that's a specific set of mechanics, not a slogan. Long-running work persists a **continuation cursor**, so a run interrupted mid-page resumes where it stopped instead of rescanning from the top (with a one-shot guard that restarts fresh exactly once if the stored cursor turns out to be poison). **Leases** in the config DB stop two instances — or the scheduler and a run-now click — from executing the same rule concurrently, and a lapsed lease never resurrects. On boot, runs left in `running` by a dead process are marked failed with an operator-visible row, and pending maintenance jobs are re-queued — a restart mid-migration resumes the migration rather than orphaning a half-moved bucket. A cancelled migration before the routing flip unwinds cleanly; the source is never deleted on a failed run.

## The event outbox: the durable journal underneath

Two features — webhook/Slack notifications and event-driven replication — share one foundation: every successful object mutation appends a fact to a durable `event_outbox` table, and consumers drain it on their own cursors. The append is the only thing the S3 write path does; delivery never blocks a PUT, a dead webhook endpoint can't slow uploads, and a missed event survives a crash because it's a row, not an in-memory message. This is why replication can be "near-real-time" without being fragile: the outbox is the primary trigger, and a slow periodic reconcile sweeps up anything a consumer missed.

## Lifecycle vs replication

They share the transfer machinery but honor different contracts. **Replication** continuously mirrors a live source: event-driven, with conflict policies and optional delete propagation — its promise is "the destination converges on the source." **Lifecycle** is age-driven housekeeping: it acts only on expired candidates, deleting or transitioning them, optionally removing the source after a verified copy — its promise is "old data goes away, or goes somewhere colder." Because both copy through the engine, multipart ETags, encryption routing, and compression behave identically; the difference is purely *when* they act and *what they promise about the destination*.
