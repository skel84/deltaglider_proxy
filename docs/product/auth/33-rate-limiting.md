# Rate Limiting

*Throttling, concurrency limits, and abuse prevention*

DeltaGlider Proxy has several layers of protection against overload, abuse, and resource exhaustion. All limits have sensible defaults and are configurable via environment variables.

## Auth Rate Limiter

Per-IP brute force protection for SigV4 authentication and admin login endpoints.

| Setting | Default | Env var |
|---------|---------|---------|
| Max failures before lockout | 100 | `DGP_RATE_LIMIT_MAX_ATTEMPTS` |
| Rolling window | 300s (5 min) | `DGP_RATE_LIMIT_WINDOW_SECS` |
| Lockout duration | 600s (10 min) | `DGP_RATE_LIMIT_LOCKOUT_SECS` |

After a lockout expires, the failure counter resets and the IP can authenticate again.

### Progressive delay

Failed auth attempts add an artificial delay to responses, making brute force expensive even before the lockout threshold:

| Failures | Delay |
|----------|-------|
| 1–10 | none |
| 11 | 200ms |
| 12 | 400ms |
| 13 | 800ms |
| 14 | 1.6s |
| 15 | 3.2s |
| 16+ | 5s (cap) |

### IP extraction

Rate limiting requires a client IP. The proxy extracts it from `X-Forwarded-For` or `X-Real-IP` headers **only when `DGP_TRUST_PROXY_HEADERS=true`**. The default is `false` (secure-by-default: direct-to-internet deployments are protected against IP spoofing out of the box).

Set `DGP_TRUST_PROXY_HEADERS=true` when the proxy sits behind a trusted reverse proxy (nginx, Caddy, Coolify, ALB) that injects these headers.

For direct-to-internet deployments (no reverse proxy), the rate limiter falls through with no IP — rate limiting is effectively a no-op for those requests, though SigV4 signature verification and the SigV4 replay cache still apply. The admission chain's `source_ip_list` predicates use axum `ConnectInfo` (wired at startup) so they still work in the direct-to-internet case, but the rate limiter doesn't yet consume `ConnectInfo`.

## Codec Semaphore

Limits the number of concurrent xdelta3 encode/decode subprocesses. Delta reconstruction (decode) is CPU-fast but I/O-bound (fetching reference + delta from storage), so the default is generous.

| Setting | Default | Env var |
|---------|---------|---------|
| Max concurrent xdelta3 processes | `num_cpus * 4` (min 16) | `DGP_CODEC_CONCURRENCY` |

Behavior differs by operation:

- **GET (decode)**: Waits up to 60 seconds for a codec slot. If no slot becomes available, returns 503 SlowDown.
- **PUT (encode)**: Fails immediately with 503 SlowDown if no slot is available. This prevents queuing uploads that hold large request bodies in memory while waiting.

## HTTP Concurrency Limit

Caps the total number of in-flight HTTP requests across the entire server. Requests beyond the limit queue until a slot opens or the request timeout fires.

| Setting | Default | Env var |
|---------|---------|---------|
| Max concurrent requests | 1024 | `DGP_MAX_CONCURRENT_REQUESTS` |

## Request Timeout

Per-request deadline applied to all S3 API requests. Returns HTTP 504 Gateway Timeout when exceeded. Set this high enough to accommodate large delta reconstructions over slow storage links.

| Setting | Default | Env var |
|---------|---------|---------|
| Request timeout | 300s | `DGP_REQUEST_TIMEOUT_SECS` |

## Multipart Upload Limit

Caps concurrent in-progress multipart uploads. Each upload holds part data in memory until completion, so this limit prevents memory exhaustion from abandoned or excessive uploads.

| Setting | Default | Env var |
|---------|---------|---------|
| Max concurrent uploads | 1000 | `DGP_MAX_MULTIPART_UPLOADS` |

Returns 503 SlowDown when exceeded.

## Replay Detection Cache

Prevents replay attacks by caching SigV4 signatures and rejecting duplicates within the **replay window** (`DGP_REPLAY_WINDOW_SECS`, default 2s). This is independent of `DGP_CLOCK_SKEW_SECONDS` (300s), which governs how far a request timestamp may drift from the server clock during SigV4 verification — a different check.

| Setting | Default | Env var |
|---------|---------|---------|
| Replay window | 2s | `DGP_REPLAY_WINDOW_SECS` |
| Clock skew tolerance | 300s | `DGP_CLOCK_SKEW_SECONDS` |
| Max cache entries | 500,000 | — |

A duplicate of a **mutating** request (PUT/POST/DELETE) within the window is rejected with 400. A duplicate of an **idempotent read** (GET/HEAD) is tolerated and served — boto3 emits byte-identical signatures for the same request within one signing second, and replaying a read just re-reads the same bytes. Replay rejections are **not** counted toward the auth-failure lockout. Set `DGP_REPLAY_WINDOW_SECS=0` to disable replay rejection entirely. When the cache exceeds 500K entries, expired signatures are evicted first.

## S3 Backend HEAD Concurrency

During LIST operations that require per-object metadata, the proxy issues HEAD requests to the upstream S3 backend. These are rate-limited to avoid triggering S3's own SlowDown throttling.

| Setting | Default | Configurable |
|---------|---------|--------------|
| Max concurrent HEADs | 50 | No |
