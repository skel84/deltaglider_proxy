# How to gate requests before authentication

*Reject unwanted traffic — bad IPs, anonymous writes, everything during maintenance — before the proxy spends a single HMAC on it.*

Admission blocks run before signature verification, so they can do what IAM can't: refuse requests without knowing who sent them, including traffic that carries no credentials at all. Why the chain sits first is covered in [About authentication and access control](../explanation/security-model.md).

## 1. Author a block

Acme's `downloads` bucket serves a public prefix, which attracts anonymous upload attempts. Deny anonymous mutations on the whole bucket outright.

In the UI: **Settings → Access → Admission rules** → add a block, set the match fields, pick the action, and drag to position. Each block has a form view and a YAML view.

The same block in YAML:

```yaml
# validate
admission:
  blocks:
    - name: deny-anonymous-writes-downloads
      match:
        method: [PUT, POST, DELETE]
        bucket: downloads
        authenticated: false
      action: deny
```

Match predicates are AND-combined; an empty `match: {}` fires on every request. Available predicates (`method`, `source_ip` / `source_ip_list` with CIDRs, `bucket`, `path_glob`, `authenticated`) and the action shapes (`deny`, `allow-anonymous`, `continue`, `reject` with a custom status and message) are in the [configuration reference](../reference/configuration.md#admission-chain).

## 2. Order the chain

Evaluation is top-to-bottom, **first match wins** — a request that matches block 1 never reaches block 2. Put narrow exceptions above broad rules: an `allow-anonymous` for one path must sit above a `deny` that would otherwise swallow it.

Operator-authored blocks always fire before the synthesized ones (next section), so an admission `deny` can take a published public prefix offline with one rule, no bucket-config change.

## The synthesized public-prefix blocks

Below your blocks, the Admission page shows read-only `public-prefix:*` entries. The proxy generates these from each bucket's `public_prefixes` config — they grant anonymous **read-only** access and are edited via **Settings → Storage → Buckets**, not here. The `public-prefix:` name prefix is reserved; you can't author blocks with it.

## 3. Dry-run with trace

Never ship a chain you haven't traced. The trace evaluates a synthetic request against the **running** server's chain and shows which block decided, without sending real traffic.

From the CLI:

```bash
export DGP_BOOTSTRAP_PASSWORD=...
deltaglider_proxy admission trace --method PUT --path /downloads/public/installer.zip \
  --server https://s3.acme.example | jq .
```

Expect a `deny` decision naming `deny-anonymous-writes-downloads`. Re-run with `--authenticated`: the block no longer matches (its `authenticated: false` predicate fails), and the request falls through to SigV4 authentication.

The same tool lives in the UI at **Settings → Diagnostics → Trace** — it renders the decision path, the matched block, and ready-made example requests, with a Copy-as-JSON button:

![Request trace diagnostics](/_/screenshots/request-trace.jpg)

If you want explicit trace output for requests nothing matches, end the chain with a `continue` block — it's a terminal that falls through to authentication and exists exactly for diagnostic visibility.

## 4. Roll out

Apply via the UI's dirty-bar, or commit the `admission:` section to your config file and push it with `deltaglider_proxy config apply`. The chain hot-reloads — no restart. Then watch **Settings → Diagnostics → Audit** for a few minutes: denials show up with source IP and path, so a too-broad block surfaces immediately.

## Verify

```bash
# Anonymous PUT — expect 403
curl -sw "%{http_code}\n" -o /dev/null -X PUT \
  https://s3.acme.example/downloads/public/installer.zip --data-binary @installer.zip

# Anonymous GET under the public prefix — still works (the block only matches mutations)
curl -sw "%{http_code}\n" -o /dev/null \
  https://s3.acme.example/downloads/public/installer-1.2.0.zip
```

Re-run the trace from step 3 after any chain edit — it reads the live chain, so it doubles as a deployment check.
