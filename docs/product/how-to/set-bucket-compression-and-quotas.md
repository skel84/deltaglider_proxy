# How to set per-bucket compression and quotas

This guide shows you how to turn delta compression on or off per bucket, tighten the delta-ratio cutoff, and cap a bucket's size with a soft quota.

All of these live on the per-bucket policy under `storage.buckets`. From the admin UI, the same fields are at **Settings → Storage → Buckets** — expand a bucket's row to edit.

## 1. Turn compression off for a bucket

If a bucket holds content that won't delta (images, video, unique-per-upload binaries), disable compression to skip the xdelta3 CPU cost entirely:

```yaml
storage:
  buckets:
    downloads:
      compression: false    # everything stored passthrough
```

If you only want a *stricter* cutoff rather than none, set `max_delta_ratio` instead — deltas are kept only when `delta_size / original_size` is below the ratio:

```yaml
storage:
  buckets:
    releases:
      max_delta_ratio: 0.5  # only keep deltas that save ≥50%
```

## 2. Restrict compression to prefixes

Compression policy is **per-bucket**, not per-prefix. If you want some prefixes compressed and others not, do one of:

- Split into two buckets with different `compression` settings (you can alias both onto the same backend).
- Rely on `max_delta_ratio`: non-compressible files fall back to passthrough automatically when the delta isn't worth keeping — no manual intervention needed.

## 3. Know what deltas well

Delta compression pays off when most bytes repeat across stored versions: zipped releases, JARs/APKs, database dumps, tar archives, AI model variants, game builds — 60–95% savings on high-similarity workloads in practice. Whole-stream compressed archives (`.tar.gz`, `.tar.xz`, `.tar.zst`, solid `.7z`) usually don't delta, because one small change shifts bytes through the rest of the stream; container formats with independently compressed members (`.zip`, `.jar`, `.docx`) usually do. The why is in [delta compression](../explanation/delta-compression.md).

If you're unsure about your workload, test it directly with two real consecutive versions:

```bash
xdelta3 -D -e -s old-artifact new-artifact delta.vcdiff
# compare: stat -c%s delta.vcdiff  vs  stat -c%s new-artifact
```

Read the ratio against this rule of thumb:

| `delta / original` | Meaning |
|---:|---|
| `<= 0.20` | Excellent |
| `0.20–0.50` | Good |
| `0.50–0.80` | Marginal |
| `> 0.80` | Usually passthrough |

## 4. Set a soft quota

Cap a bucket's total size in bytes:

```yaml
storage:
  buckets:
    db-archive:
      quota_bytes: 536870912000   # 500 GB
```

**What happens at the quota:** PUT requests that would exceed it are rejected with `403`. The quota is **soft** — it reads from the usage scanner's 5-minute cache, so a burst of concurrent writes can overshoot by up to 5 minutes of throughput. If you need a strict hard cap, enforce it at the reverse proxy or the storage provider.

## 5. Freeze a bucket

If you need a bucket read-only (for example during a manual migration), set the quota to zero:

```yaml
storage:
  buckets:
    db-archive:
      quota_bytes: 0   # all writes blocked
```

Reads and lists keep working; every write is rejected.

## Verify

1. The policy applied:

   ```bash
   curl -b cookies https://s3.acme.example/_/api/admin/config/section/storage?format=yaml
   ```

2. Compression behaves as configured — upload two versions of a file and check the `x-amz-storage-type` header on a HEAD: `delta` means compressed, `passthrough` means not.

3. The quota bites — on a frozen bucket, a PUT should fail with `403`:

   ```bash
   aws --endpoint-url https://s3.acme.example s3 cp probe.txt s3://db-archive/probe.txt
   ```

4. Savings show up per bucket on the Metrics page and via the O(1) usage counter — `curl https://s3.acme.example/_/stats?bucket=db-archive` (or `GET /_/api/admin/usage/bucket/db-archive` for the full counter row). The counter is maintained inline on every write; if it ever drifts, reconcile with `POST /_/api/admin/usage/refresh?bucket=db-archive`.
