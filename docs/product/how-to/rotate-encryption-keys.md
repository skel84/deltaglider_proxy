# How to rotate or change encryption keys

This guide shows you how to change a backend's encryption key or mode without losing access to historical objects. There is no in-place rotation: changing `key` alone makes old objects unreadable. Every safe path goes through either the `legacy_key` read shim or a data rewrite — background in [encryption at rest](../explanation/encryption-at-rest.md), shim semantics in the [encryption reference](../reference/encryption.md#the-legacy_key-shim).

## Which recipe do you need?

| You want to… | Recipe |
|---|---|
| Rotate a proxy-AES key, minimum disruption | **A** — shim, then re-encrypt job |
| Rotate so the old key never stays in runtime | **B** — new backend + migrate job |
| Move from proxy-AES to SSE-KMS / SSE-S3 | **C** — mode change with shim |
| Stop encrypting a backend | **D** — `mode: none`, keep the shim |

## Recipe A: shim-assisted rotation

1. Generate the new key off-box (`openssl rand -hex 32` into your secrets manager). Keep the old one — you need both for a while.
2. Move the old key into the `legacy_key` slot and put the new key in `key`:

   ```yaml
   encryption:
     mode: aes256-gcm-proxy
     key: "${env:DGP_NEW_KEY}"
     key_id: prod-2026-06
     legacy_key: "${env:DGP_OLD_KEY}"
     legacy_key_id: prod-2025-10      # the id stamped on old objects
   ```

   Apply (hot-reload or restart). New writes now use the new key; reads check the new key id first and fall back to the legacy slot. The admin panel shows an info banner while a shim is active.

3. Run a **Re-encrypt job** to rewrite the historical objects under the new key: **Settings → Jobs → + New job → Re-encrypt buckets…**, or:

   ```bash
   curl -b cookies -X POST https://s3.acme.example/_/api/admin/jobs/reencrypt \
     -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
     -d '{"buckets": ["db-archive", "releases"]}'
   ```

   One durable job per bucket (max 100 per call). While a bucket's job runs, **writes** to it get `503 SlowDown` — SDKs back off and retry — so no racing PUT can land under the old key; **reads pass untouched**. The job survives proxy restarts and resumes from its cursor; watch objects/bytes progress on the Jobs screen.

4. When every job shows `succeeded`, remove `legacy_key` + `legacy_key_id` and apply. The old key can now be destroyed.

**Caveat:** the shim holds exactly ONE legacy generation. Don't rotate again while a shim is live — rotate to the final key, not through intermediaries.

## Recipe B: rotation via data migration (zero-shim)

Use when the old key must not remain in runtime at all.

1. Declare a NEW backend with the new key (same underlying storage or different). Route no buckets to it yet.
2. Move each bucket with the built-in migrate job — **Settings → Storage → Buckets → (bucket) → Migrate data…** or `POST /_/api/admin/buckets/:bucket/migrate` with the new backend as `target_backend`. The proxy decrypts with the old key on read and re-encrypts with the new key on write; the job is durable, resumable, cancellable pre-flip, and write-gates the bucket. Full procedure: [How to move a bucket to another backend](move-a-bucket-between-backends.md).
3. Once all buckets are flipped, delete the old backend from the config. The old key can be forgotten.

## Recipe C: migrate from proxy-AES to SSE-KMS

Same shape as recipe A, with a mode change:

```yaml
encryption:
  mode: sse-kms
  kms_key_id: arn:aws:kms:eu-west-1:123456789012:key/new-kms
  legacy_key: "${env:DGP_OLD_PROXY_KEY}"
  legacy_key_id: prod-2025-10
```

New writes go through SSE-KMS (the proxy-AES write path is skipped entirely); reads of old proxy-stamped objects decrypt via the shim. Run a re-encrypt job to rewrite them natively, then clear the legacy fields. The reverse direction (native → proxy-AES) needs no shim — native objects carry `dg-encrypted-native`, so the proxy decrypt path never fires on them.

## Recipe D: decommission encryption safely

```yaml
encryption:
  mode: none
  legacy_key: "${env:DGP_OLD_KEY}"
  legacy_key_id: prod-2025-10
```

New writes are plaintext; historical encrypted objects stay readable through the shim (`mode: none` with a `legacy_key` is a valid shape). If you want history decrypted on disk too, run a re-encrypt job — it rewrites toward the *current* config, so under `mode: none` it decrypts. Only drop the `legacy_key` once nothing encrypted remains.

## Two questions that come up

**What if I lose ONLY the `legacy_key` after clearing it?** Nothing new — that's the same state as "the shim was never set." If the re-encrypt job already rewrote everything, no object references the old generation and nothing is lost. If some still do, those objects are unrecoverable, like any other key loss.

**How do I audit who's decrypting?** Under SSE-KMS, turn on CloudTrail for the KMS key — every `Decrypt` / `GenerateDataKey` call logs principal, IP, and timestamp. Proxy-AES has no equivalent: the key never moves, so there's no per-decrypt event — only the proxy's own access logs.

## Verify

1. Every bucket's re-encrypt (or migrate) job shows `succeeded` at **Settings → Jobs**, with zero rows in **Failures**.
2. Every object still reads — spot-check old and new objects through the proxy:

   ```bash
   aws --endpoint-url https://s3.acme.example s3 cp s3://db-archive/nightly/2025-01-01.dump - | sha256sum
   ```

3. On the raw backend, a rewritten object's `dg-encryption-key-id` metadata shows the **new** key id.
4. The shim banner in the admin panel is gone after you clear `legacy_key`.
5. A read failing with "object was encrypted with key id X, but this backend is configured with key id Y" means some objects were missed — restore the shim and re-run the job ([troubleshooting](troubleshooting.md)).
