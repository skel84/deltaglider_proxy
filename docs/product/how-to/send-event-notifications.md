# How to send events to webhooks and Slack

This guide shows you how to deliver object events (created, deleted, copied, replicated, expired) to an HTTP webhook or a Slack channel. Delivery rides on the durable event outbox, so the S3 write path never waits on your endpoint — semantics in the [event outbox reference](../reference/event-outbox.md).

## 1. Configure a webhook destination

```yaml
# validate
advanced:
  event_delivery:
    enabled: true
    webhook_url: "https://events.example.com/deltaglider"
    webhook_headers:
      authorization: "Bearer YOUR-TOKEN"
```

Add fan-out endpoints with `webhook_urls: [...]` — every endpoint receives every event, and a row counts as delivered only when **all** endpoints return 2xx. Each POST body is the `{schema, event}` JSON envelope; full payload schema and tuning knobs (`tick_interval`, `batch_size`, `max_attempts`, retention) are in the [reference](../reference/event-outbox.md#yaml-grammar).

From the admin UI: **Settings → Integrations → Event delivery**.

Delivery is at-least-once — make the receiver idempotent, typically by deduplicating on `event.id`.

## 2. Filter what gets sent

Raw webhook mode delivers **every** event kind; filter at the receiver on `event.kind` (`ObjectCreated`, `ObjectDeleted`, `ObjectCopied`, `ReplicationObjectCopied`, `LifecycleExpired`, `LifecycleTransitioned`).

In Slack format you filter at the source instead:

```yaml
    slack_notify_kinds: ["ObjectCreated", "ObjectDeleted"]   # default: ObjectCreated only
    slack_include_globs: ["firmware/**"]                     # empty = all user objects
    slack_exclude_globs: ["**/*.tmp"]                        # exclude wins
```

Directory markers and DeltaGlider internals are never posted in Slack mode.

## 3. Slack instead of raw JSON

Set `format: slack` to post formatted messages. No OAuth is involved — you paste a credential, so this works even when the proxy runs at a private address (delivery is outbound HTTPS only). Two mutually exclusive modes:

- **If one channel is enough**, use an Incoming Webhook. In Slack: create an app → enable *Incoming Webhooks* → pick a channel → copy the `https://hooks.slack.com/services/…` URL:

  ```yaml
  advanced:
    event_delivery:
      enabled: true
      format: slack
      webhook_url: "https://hooks.slack.com/services/T000/B000/XXXX"
  ```

- **If you want multiple channels or per-bucket routing**, use a bot token. In Slack: create an app → add the `chat:write` and `chat:write.public` scopes → install to the workspace → copy the `xoxb-…` token:

  ```yaml
  advanced:
    event_delivery:
      enabled: true
      format: slack
      slack_bot_token: "xoxb-…"
      slack_channel: "#ops"          # fallback channel
      slack_routes:
        - name: "Releases → #ci"
          bucket: "releases"
          prefix_globs: ["firmware/**"]
          channel: "C_CI"
  ```

The bot token is masked on export and in the GUI; an unchanged round-trip preserves the real token. The UI at **Settings → Integrations → Event delivery** includes a live preview of the message that will land in the channel.

## 4. Test a delivery

1. Apply the config, then upload something:

   ```bash
   aws --endpoint-url https://dgp.example.com s3 cp probe.txt s3://releases/probe.txt
   ```

2. Within one `tick_interval` (10s default) the dispatcher claims the row and POSTs it. Check your endpoint logs or the Slack channel.
3. Check the row's status in the outbox at **Settings → Integrations → Event outbox**, or:

   ```bash
   curl -b cookies "https://dgp.example.com/_/api/admin/event-outbox?limit=10"
   ```

## 5. Retries and requeue

Failed attempts retry with exponential backoff. After `max_attempts` (default 8) a row goes permanently `failed` until you requeue it — fix the endpoint first, then:

```bash
# one row
curl -b cookies -X POST https://dgp.example.com/_/api/admin/event-outbox/123/requeue
# several
curl -b cookies -X POST https://dgp.example.com/_/api/admin/event-outbox/requeue \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"ids": [123, 124]}'
```

Requeue doesn't create a new event — it flips `failed` back to `pending`, keeps the attempt history, and makes the row due immediately. The Event outbox page does the same with a button.

Note Slack's Web API returns HTTP 200 even on failure; the dispatcher checks the JSON `ok` field and retries on `{"ok": false}` (e.g. `channel_not_found`), so Slack misconfigurations show up as retries, not silent drops.

## 6. Monitor outbox depth

The outbox list response carries per-status counts (`pending`, `in_progress`, `delivered`, `failed`). A growing `pending` count means the dispatcher can't keep up or the endpoint is down; a non-zero `failed` count means rows are waiting on you. Watch the counts on the Event outbox page, poll the endpoint above from your monitoring, and see the [metrics reference](../reference/metrics.md) for the Prometheus side. Delivered rows are pruned automatically; pending and failed rows are not.

## Verify

1. A fresh PUT produces an `ObjectCreated` row that reaches `delivered` within seconds.
2. Your receiver (or Slack channel) shows the event, with the expected filtering applied.
3. `failed` count is zero — and if it isn't, a requeue after fixing the endpoint drains it.
