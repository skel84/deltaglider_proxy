# How to expire and archive objects

This guide shows you how to delete objects past a certain age with a lifecycle rule, or transition them to a colder bucket instead — and how to preview the blast radius before anything is deleted. Full rule grammar is in the [lifecycle reference](../reference/lifecycle.md).

## 1. Write an expiry rule

Delete nightly DB dumps older than 90 days from `db-archive`:

```yaml
# validate
storage:
  lifecycle:
    enabled: true                  # global switch — required for execution
    rules:
      - name: expire-nightly-dumps
        enabled: false             # keep off until you've previewed
        bucket: db-archive
        prefix: "nightly/"
        action: delete
        expire_after: "90d"
        include_globs: ["nightly/**/*.dump"]
        exclude_globs: ["nightly/golden/**"]
```

From the admin UI: **Settings → Jobs** — lifecycle rules live in the storage-section editor on the Jobs screen.

Lifecycle is off by default and triple-gated: the rule must exist, `lifecycle.enabled` must be `true`, and the rule's own `enabled` must be `true` before the scheduler or run-now deletes anything. Leave the rule disabled until step 3.

## 2. Or write a transition rule

If the objects should move somewhere cold instead of dying, make `action` a transition:

```yaml
        action:
          type: transition
          destination:
            bucket: db-archive
            prefix: "cold/nightly/"
          delete_source_after_success: false   # copy (archive) semantics
```

`delete_source_after_success: false` archives — the source stays. Set it to `true` for move semantics; lifecycle copies first, verifies the destination, and deletes the source only after the copy succeeds.

## 3. Preview first

Always dry-run before enabling. Preview works even while the rule is disabled, is strictly read-only, and writes no history rows:

```bash
curl -b cookies -X POST \
  https://dgp.example.com/_/api/admin/jobs/lifecycle:expire-nightly-dumps/preview
```

From the admin UI: the **Preview** button on the rule's row on the Jobs screen.

![Lifecycle preview](/_/screenshots/lifecycle-preview.jpg)

Check the response: `objects_affected` and `bytes_affected` are the blast radius, and `candidates` lists exactly which keys would be deleted or transitioned, with their age and size. If the candidate list contains anything that should survive, fix the rule's `prefix` / globs / `expire_after` and preview again until it's right.

## 4. Enable and run

Flip the rule's `enabled: true` and apply. The scheduler now executes it when due. To run it immediately instead of waiting:

```bash
curl -b cookies -X POST \
  https://dgp.example.com/_/api/admin/jobs/lifecycle:expire-nightly-dumps/run-now
```

A `409` means the rule is disabled, paused, or already running.

If you need to stop the rule temporarily (incident, audit freeze), pause it from the job row or `POST …/pause`. Paused rules are skipped by the scheduler and run-now alike, and the pause survives restarts; `…/resume` re-arms it.

## 5. Read the history

Every execution is persisted. On the Jobs screen, the rule's drawer shows **Runs** (when, triggered by scheduler or run-now, objects/bytes affected, terminal status) and **Failures** (per-object errors with the run that observed them). Via the API:

```bash
curl -b cookies https://dgp.example.com/_/api/admin/jobs/lifecycle:expire-nightly-dumps/runs?limit=10
curl -b cookies https://dgp.example.com/_/api/admin/jobs/lifecycle:expire-nightly-dumps/failures
```

## The guardrails that protect you

Lifecycle never touches:

- Directory markers (`folder/`).
- DeltaGlider internal prefixes (`.deltaglider/**`, `.dg/**`) and storage artifacts (`reference.bin`, `*.delta`).
- Keys matched by `exclude_globs`, or outside `include_globs` when includes are set.
- Keys newer than `expire_after`.

And structurally: a transition copy failure never deletes the source; deletes are idempotent; preview takes no locks and writes nothing; a crash mid-run resumes from a stored cursor instead of rescanning ([how](../explanation/jobs-and-durability.md)).

## Verify

1. After the first run, the run history shows `succeeded` and `objects_affected` matches what the preview predicted.
2. An expired key is gone (or landed in the cold prefix for transitions):

   ```bash
   aws --endpoint-url https://dgp.example.com s3 ls s3://db-archive/nightly/
   aws --endpoint-url https://dgp.example.com s3 ls s3://db-archive/cold/nightly/
   ```

3. Excluded keys (`nightly/golden/**`) are still there.
4. If you have event delivery configured, `LifecycleExpired` / `LifecycleTransitioned` events appear in the outbox ([how to send them somewhere](send-event-notifications.md)).
