# How to move a bucket to another backend

This guide shows you how to relocate a bucket's data from one backend to another with the built-in migrate job. The example moves `db-archive` from `local-disk` to `hetzner-fsn1`. For how the job survives crashes and gates writes, see [jobs and durability](../explanation/jobs-and-durability.md).

## Before you start

- **Reads keep working** for the whole migration.
- **Writes get `503 SlowDown`** while the job runs. AWS SDKs back off and retry automatically, so well-behaved clients just slow down; anything that treats 503 as fatal should be paused. The gate lifts the moment the bucket flips to the new backend — before any optional source cleanup.
- The target backend must already be declared in `storage.backends` (see [How to route a bucket to a different backend](route-a-bucket-to-a-backend.md)).
- The copy goes through the engine, so encryption and delta compression stay transparent — each side applies its own configuration. You can move between backends with different encryption modes or keys.

## 1. Start the job

From the admin UI: **Settings → Storage → Buckets → (db-archive) → Migrate data…**, pick `hetzner-fsn1` as the target, and leave "delete source" off.

Or via the API:

```bash
curl -b cookies -X POST \
  https://s3.acme.example/_/api/admin/buckets/db-archive/migrate \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"target_backend": "hetzner-fsn1", "delete_source": false}'
```

The response is `202 Accepted` with a `maintenance:<n>` job id. `delete_source` defaults to `false` — the safe path leaves the source copy in place for you to remove after verifying.

The job stages the destination, copies every object through the engine, verifies, flips the bucket's routing to the new backend, and cleans up.

## 2. Watch it run

Open **Settings → Jobs**. The migration appears as a `maintenance:<n>` row with live progress (objects and bytes); the drawer shows its run and any per-object failures.

Same data via the API:

```bash
curl -b cookies https://s3.acme.example/_/api/admin/jobs
curl -b cookies https://s3.acme.example/_/api/admin/jobs/maintenance:7/failures
```

If something looks wrong, cancel from the job row (or `POST /_/api/admin/jobs/maintenance:7/cancel`). A cancel before the routing flip unwinds cleanly, and the source is never deleted on a failed or cancelled run.

A proxy restart mid-job does not orphan the bucket: the job is re-queued on boot and resumes from its cursor ([details](../explanation/jobs-and-durability.md)).

## 3. Verify

1. The job row shows `succeeded` and the bucket row at **Settings → Storage → Buckets** now shows backend `hetzner-fsn1`.
2. Read an object through the proxy and compare it to a pre-migration checksum:

   ```bash
   aws --endpoint-url https://s3.acme.example s3 cp s3://db-archive/nightly/2026-06-10.dump - | sha256sum
   ```

3. Writes work again:

   ```bash
   aws --endpoint-url https://s3.acme.example s3 cp probe.txt s3://db-archive/probe.txt
   ```

4. Object counts match — list through the proxy and compare against the source backend's own listing.

## 4. Clean up the source (optional)

Once verified, delete the old copy yourself — for the example, the `db-archive` data directory on `local-disk`. If you'd rather have the job do it, pass `"delete_source": true` when starting the migration; cleanup then runs only after the flip succeeds.
