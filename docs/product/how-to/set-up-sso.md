# How to set up OAuth/OIDC single sign-on

*Let humans sign in to the admin UI with the identity provider they already have, and land in the right IAM group automatically.*

## Prerequisites

- The proxy reachable at a URL the identity provider can redirect to — `https://s3.acme.example` in production. `http://localhost:9000` works for testing against providers that accept localhost callbacks.
- Admin access to the UI (bootstrap password or an IAM admin like `dana`).
- An IAM group to map people into — this guide uses `Engineering` (see [How to create IAM users and groups](create-iam-users.md)).

## 1. Register the app with your provider

Every provider needs the same redirect URL — note there is **no provider-name suffix**; the callback is generic:

```
https://s3.acme.example/_/api/admin/oauth/callback
```

If you use Google (Cloud Console):

1. APIs & Services → Credentials → Create credentials → OAuth client ID.
2. Application type: **Web application**.
3. Authorized redirect URIs: add the callback URL above.
4. Save, then copy the **Client ID** and **Client Secret**.

If you use Okta:

1. Applications → Create App Integration → **OIDC**, **Web Application**.
2. Sign-in redirect URIs: the callback URL above.
3. Assignments: pick the Okta groups that should be allowed to log in.
4. Copy the **Client ID** and **Client Secret**.

If you use Azure AD / Entra:

1. App registrations → New registration; Redirect URI (Web): the callback URL above.
2. Certificates & secrets → New client secret. Copy the value immediately — Azure hides it on the next page load.
3. API permissions → Microsoft Graph → `openid`, `profile`, `email`; add `GroupMember.Read.All` if you'll map on AD groups.
4. Copy the **Application (client) ID** and the secret value.

If you use any other OIDC provider: it works as long as it serves `.well-known/openid-configuration`. Collect the issuer URL, client ID, client secret, and scopes (at minimum `openid email`; add `profile` and `groups` if you map on them).

## 2. Add the provider in the admin UI

Go to **Settings → Access → External authentication** → **+ Add provider**.

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Name | lower-case ASCII id — appears in the sign-in button (`Sign in with okta`) |
| Display name | human-readable label shown on the login page |
| Provider type | `google` / `okta` / `azure` / `oidc` |
| Issuer URL | required for `oidc`; pre-filled for named providers |
| Client ID / Client secret | from step 1 |
| Scopes | `openid email profile` minimum; add `groups` per your provider |
| Enabled | ✓ |
| Priority | lower number = shown first on the login page |

Save, then use the provider row's **Test** action: the proxy fetches the issuer's `.well-known/openid-configuration` and reports DNS, TLS, or connectivity problems before any human tries to log in.

## 3. Map IdP groups to IAM groups

Mapping rules decide which IAM groups a fresh identity lands in, based on its claims. Acme maps the Okta `engineering` group to the `Engineering` IAM group.

Go to **Settings → Access → External authentication** → **Mapping rules** → **+ Add rule**.

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Name | `okta-engineering` |
| Priority | rules evaluate in ascending priority; first match wins |
| Match | claim path `groups`, value `engineering` (exact match; globs `*`/`?` supported) |
| Target groups | `Engineering` |

Common claim paths: Google `hd` (hosted domain) or `email` (`*@acme.example`); Okta `groups`; Azure AD `groups` (UUIDs) or `roles` for app roles.

Use the **Preview** button before relying on a rule: paste an email or claim set and the UI shows which groups that identity would receive — cheaper than logging in as them. Group memberships are merged on each login, never replaced, so manual assignments survive SSO.

## 4. First login

Open the login page in a private window. A "Sign in with Okta" button now appears:

Have `dana` click it. She authenticates at the provider, consents, and is redirected back. On success:

- A row appears in **Settings → Access → External authentication → Identities**, linking the provider's subject ID to a DeltaGlider user.
- Matching mapping rules fire — `dana` is now a member of `Engineering`.
- She gets a session cookie and lands in the admin UI.

Every successful OAuth login shows as `external_login` in **Settings → Diagnostics → Audit**; rejections show as `access_denied`.

## If the login fails

Three failure modes are provider-side, not proxy-side:

1. **`invalid_redirect_uri` at the provider.** The registered URI doesn't byte-for-byte match `https://s3.acme.example/_/api/admin/oauth/callback` — watch trailing slashes and `http` vs `https`. If a reverse proxy fronts DeltaGlider, also confirm it forwards the same `Host` header the user sees.
2. **Azure `groups` claim missing.** Azure AD omits groups by default; in the app registration go to Token configuration → Add groups claim, then retry the flow.
3. **"Token exchange failed" in the audit log.** The proxy couldn't reach the provider's token endpoint. From the proxy container, run `curl -v https://<issuer>/.well-known/openid-configuration` — if that fails, fix DNS/network/TLS first; it isn't an OAuth problem.

If login succeeds but the user has no permissions, no mapping rule matched — check with the Preview tool, and verify the auto-created user row in **Settings → Access → Users**. If you rotate the client secret at the provider, update it in the provider form; it takes effect on save, no restart.

## Verify

1. Log in via the provider as a user in the mapped IdP group — expect a session and membership of `Engineering` (visible on the user's row).
2. Log in as a user **outside** the mapped group — expect a login that lands with no group memberships (or no login at all, if the provider restricts assignments).
3. Confirm both attempts in the audit log.
