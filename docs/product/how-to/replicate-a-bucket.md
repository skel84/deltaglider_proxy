# How to replicate a bucket to another backend

This guide shows you how to mirror a bucket to a second backend with a replication rule. The example mirrors `releases` to `releases-dr` on the `aws-dr` backend. For the full rule grammar and failure semantics, see the [replication reference](../reference/replication.md).

## 1. Create the destination bucket

Route `releases-dr` to the backend that should hold the copies:

```yaml
storage:
  buckets:
    releases-dr:
      backend: aws-dr
```

## 2. Define the rule

Add the rule under `storage.replication`:

```yaml
# validate
storage:
  replication:
    enabled: true
    rules:
      - name: mirror-releases-to-dr
        enabled: true
        source:
          bucket: releases
          prefix: ""              # "" = entire bucket
        destination:
          bucket: releases-dr
          prefix: ""
        interval: "24h"           # full-reconcile safety net
        replicate_deletes: false
        conflict: newer-wins
        exclude_globs: [".deltaglider/**"]
```

From the admin UI: **Settings → Jobs** — replication rules live in the storage-section editor on the Jobs screen; add the rule and apply.

Replication has two triggers: **event-driven** copies each PUT/DELETE/COPY in near-real time (the primary path), and the rule's `interval` schedules a slow full reconcile as the self-healing backstop. You don't choose between them — both run; `interval` only sets how often the backstop sweeps ([details](../reference/replication.md#triggers)).

Every copy goes through the engine, so each side applies its own encryption and compression — you can replicate from an encrypted backend to a plaintext one and vice versa.

## 3. Scope what replicates

- If only part of the bucket matters, set `source.prefix` (e.g. `firmware/`) — or narrow further with `include_globs: ["firmware/widget-3000/**"]`. When includes are set, only matching keys replicate.
- If some keys must never leave (scratch files, temp uploads), add them to `exclude_globs` — exclude wins over include. Keep `.deltaglider/**` excluded; it protects the config-sync prefix when a bucket doubles as user data.
- If the destination should use a different layout, set `destination.prefix` — source keys are re-rooted under it.

Directory markers and storage-layer delta artifacts never replicate; the engine listing filters them before planning ([full list](../reference/replication.md#what-doesnt-replicate)).

## 4. Pick a conflict policy

- If the destination is write-only DR (nothing else writes to `releases-dr`), keep the default `newer-wins`: copies happen only when the source is strictly newer.
- If the source must always win, even over manual edits on the destination, use `source-wins`.
- If you're seeding a bucket once and never overwriting, use `skip-if-dest-exists`.

## 5. Decide on delete replication

By default, deletes do not propagate — `releases-dr` keeps objects that vanish from `releases`. If you want a true mirror, set `replicate_deletes: true`. The guardrail is provenance: delete replication only removes destination objects this rule itself wrote; manually created objects and objects from other rules are preserved.

## 6. Run it now

The first sync doesn't have to wait for events or the interval:

```bash
curl -b cookies -X POST \
  https://dgp.example.com/_/api/admin/jobs/replication:mirror-releases-to-dr/run-now
```

```json
{
  "run_id": 42,
  "status": "succeeded",
  "objects_scanned": 3,
  "objects_copied": 3,
  "objects_skipped": 0,
  "bytes_copied": 15,
  "errors": 0
}
```

If you get `409 Conflict`, the rule is already running (or paused) — check the Jobs screen.

## 7. Watch it in Jobs

**Settings → Jobs** shows the rule as row `replication:mirror-releases-to-dr` with its status and last run. The drawer's **Runs** tab lists every execution; **Failures** lists per-object errors (a few failed objects don't fail the run — the next pass catches them up).

![Job runs drawer](/_/screenshots/jobs-drawer-runs.jpg)

The same data via the API:

```bash
curl -b cookies https://dgp.example.com/_/api/admin/jobs/replication:mirror-releases-to-dr/runs?limit=10
curl -b cookies https://dgp.example.com/_/api/admin/jobs/replication:mirror-releases-to-dr/failures
```

Pause and resume from the job row (or `POST …/pause` / `…/resume`); paused rules are skipped by events, the scheduler, and run-now alike, and the pause survives restarts.

## Verify

1. The destination has the objects:

   ```bash
   aws --endpoint-url https://dgp.example.com s3 ls s3://releases-dr/firmware/widget-3000/
   ```

2. Content is byte-identical:

   ```bash
   aws --endpoint-url https://dgp.example.com s3 cp s3://releases-dr/firmware/widget-3000/fw-2.4.1.tar - | sha256sum
   ```

3. Near-real-time copy works — upload a new object to `releases` and watch it appear on `releases-dr` within seconds:

   ```bash
   aws --endpoint-url https://dgp.example.com s3 cp fw-2.4.2.tar s3://releases/firmware/widget-3000/fw-2.4.2.tar
   aws --endpoint-url https://dgp.example.com s3 ls s3://releases-dr/firmware/widget-3000/
   ```

4. The run history shows `succeeded` with `errors: 0`.
