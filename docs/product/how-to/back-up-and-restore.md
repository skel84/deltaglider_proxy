# How to back up and restore

This guide shows you how to back up DeltaGlider Proxy's state — config, IAM, and secrets — and restore it onto the same or a fresh instance.

One thing first: **object data is not in any of these backups.** Objects live in your storage backend (`hetzner-fsn1`, `local-disk`, …); back that up with your storage provider's tools. What the proxy itself owns is the config file, the encrypted IAM DB, and the infra secrets.

## Pick the right mechanism

Three mechanisms, routinely confused:

| Mechanism | What it is | Use it when |
|---|---|---|
| **Full Backup** (zip via admin API) | Operator-initiated, point-in-time snapshot: config + IAM + secrets, sha256-verified, atomic restore | Before every upgrade; on a schedule; before risky config changes. This is THE backup. |
| **DB snapshot** (file copy) | Filesystem-level copy of `deltaglider_config.db` (SQLCipher-encrypted SQLite) | You already snapshot volumes (PVC snapshots, ZFS, etc.) and preserve the bootstrap password alongside |
| **S3 config sync** (`config_sync_bucket`) | Automatic live replication of the encrypted DB across instances | Horizontal scaling / blue-green — see [How to run multiple instances](run-multiple-instances.md). **Not a backup**: a bad mutation propagates to every reader. |

You want Full Backup regardless; the other two are complements, not substitutes.

## Take a Full Backup

![Full Backup export and restore](/_/screenshots/backup-restore.jpg)

From the admin UI: **Settings → System → Backup → Export**. Or via API:

```bash
curl -b /tmp/admin.cookies \
  "https://s3.acme.example/_/api/admin/backup" \
  -o dgp-backup-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S).zip
```

The zip contains four artefacts, each sha256-listed in the manifest:

- `manifest.json` — version, timestamp, checksums
- `config.yaml` — canonical YAML, secrets redacted
- `iam.json` — users, groups, OAuth providers, mapping rules, external identities
- `secrets.json` — **plaintext** infra secrets: bootstrap hash, OAuth client_secrets, storage creds

`secrets.json` makes the zip a keystore — treat it like one. Store it encrypted, off the host, somewhere the upgrade or incident you're protecting against can't reach. Take a fresh one after any password change: the zip carries both the bootstrap hash and the encrypted DB, so a fresh instance can be reconstituted from it alone.

## Restore a Full Backup

```bash
curl -b cookies -X POST \
  -H "Content-Type: application/zip" \
  --data-binary @dgp-backup-20260612-090000.zip \
  https://s3.acme.example/_/api/admin/backup
```

The import is atomic: all four parts are unpacked and sha256-verified before any state changes. `external_identities` are remapped through the imported user and provider IDs, so OAuth users keep working. A legacy JSON-only body is still accepted for IAM-only restores from pre-v0.8.4 scripts.

If you're restoring onto a **fresh instance** and the import fails with a SQLCipher error, the new instance's bootstrap password doesn't match the DB. Inject the original `DGP_BOOTSTRAP_PASSWORD_HASH` (it's in the zip's `secrets.json`) before retrying.

## Snapshot the DB file

`deltaglider_config.db` is safe to copy at the file level — it's encrypted at rest. The snapshot is only useful if the **bootstrap password is preserved with it**: the password derives the DB encryption key. Snapshot the file, store the password (or hash) in your secret manager, and the pair restores onto any instance.

## The xattr warning (filesystem backend)

If you back up a **filesystem backend's data directory** with file copies, your tool must preserve extended attributes — per-object metadata lives in the `user.dg.metadata` xattr on each file's inode. A tool that copies contents but drops xattrs (older `rsync` without `-X`, many archive tools) produces a restore where encrypted objects fail to read and delta objects lose their metadata.

```bash
rsync -aX /var/lib/deltaglider_proxy/data/ /backup/dgp-data/   # -X = preserve xattrs
```

The classic symptom after a bad restore: reads return 500 with "xattrs may have been stripped during backup/restore" — see [Troubleshooting](troubleshooting.md).

## Verify

After a restore:

```bash
# Health
curl -s https://s3.acme.example/_/health

# IAM users came back
curl -b cookies https://s3.acme.example/_/api/admin/users | jq '.[] | .name'
# expect: ci-uploader, backup-bot, dana, ...

# A known object still reads byte-identical
aws --endpoint-url https://s3.acme.example s3 cp s3://releases/known-file ./out
sha256sum out   # matches the recorded checksum
```

And log in to the admin UI with the bootstrap password — if that works, the DB and hash are in agreement.
