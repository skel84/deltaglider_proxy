# How to publish a folder publicly

*Serve one prefix to the world — `curl`-able installers, no credentials — while the rest of the bucket stays locked.*

## 1. Mark the prefix public

Acme publishes installers from `public/` in the `downloads` bucket. In YAML:

```yaml
# validate
storage:
  buckets:
    downloads:
      public_prefixes:
        - public/
```

Or in the UI: **Settings → Storage → Buckets** → expand the `downloads` row → **Anonymous read access** → pick **Specific prefixes** and add `public/`:

![Bucket policies with the public-access tri-state](/_/screenshots/bucket-policies.jpg)

The tri-state maps directly to the YAML: **None** (no anonymous access), **Specific prefixes** (`public_prefixes: [...]`), **Entire bucket** (`public: true`).

Apply the change — it hot-reloads; the proxy synthesizes a read-only `public-prefix:downloads` admission block from it.

## 2. Know what anonymous callers get

Anonymous requests can GET, HEAD, and LIST under the prefix (LIST results never escape it), run as an audited `$anonymous` user, and can never write — full semantics in the [authentication reference](../reference/authentication.md#public-prefixes).

## Mind the trailing slash

`public/` matches `public/installer.zip` but **not** `publicity/report.pdf`; `public` (no slash) is a string-prefix match and would expose both. Always end the prefix with `/` unless you deliberately want string-prefix matching.

## Whole-bucket public

`public: true` is shorthand for `public_prefixes: [""]` — every object in the bucket becomes anonymously readable:

```yaml
# validate
storage:
  buckets:
    downloads:
      public: true
```

The proxy logs a startup warning when a whole bucket is public. Use it only for buckets that contain nothing but published artifacts — anything uploaded there later is public the moment it lands, and LIST exposes every key name in the bucket.

If you only need to share one object for a limited time, don't publish a prefix at all — generate a presigned URL instead (expires after at most 7 days, revocable by rotating the signing user's key):

```bash
aws --endpoint-url https://s3.acme.example \
  s3 presign s3://downloads/internal/draft-installer.zip --expires-in 3600
```

## Verify with a cold curl

Test from a shell with **no** AWS environment — a leftover `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` would authenticate the request and prove nothing (credentials always win over public-prefix config):

```bash
env -i curl -sw "%{http_code}\n" -o /dev/null \
  https://s3.acme.example/downloads/public/installer-1.2.0.zip
# 200

env -i curl -sw "%{http_code}\n" -o /dev/null \
  https://s3.acme.example/downloads/internal/roadmap.pdf
# 403 — outside the public prefix

env -i curl -sw "%{http_code}\n" -o /dev/null -X PUT \
  https://s3.acme.example/downloads/public/evil.zip -d x
# 403 — anonymous writes are always denied
```

Anonymous fetches appear in **Settings → Observability → Audit** as `user=$anonymous`.

## Lock writes down

Publishing a prefix doesn't change who can write to it — review that separately:

- Scope upload credentials to the prefix and pin them to your network: [How to restrict access by IP and prefix](restrict-access-with-conditions.md).
- Reject anonymous mutation attempts on the bucket before authentication even runs: [How to gate requests before authentication](gate-requests-with-admission-rules.md).
