# How to trace and audit requests

This guide shows you how to find out why the proxy allowed or denied a request — by dry-running a synthetic request through the admission chain, reading the audit log, and turning on debug headers.

## 1. Check the audit log first

When a client reports a denial, start at **Observability → Audit log** (`/_/admin/diagnostics/audit`). Every IAM denial lands there with the user, action, bucket, and path — usually that's the whole investigation. The same data is available as JSON:

```bash
curl -b cookies "https://s3.acme.example/_/api/admin/audit?limit=500"
```

If the audit log shows nothing for the failing request, the denial happened **before** IAM — in SigV4 verification or the admission chain. That's what tracing is for.

Know what the ring is: an **in-memory** buffer (default 500 entries, `DGP_AUDIT_RING_SIZE` to raise it) that resets to empty on every restart. The persistent audit source is stdout — every `audit_log()` call also emits a `tracing::info!` line; ship those into your log pipeline for retention.

## 2. Trace a synthetic request

Three equivalent front doors to the same evaluator — none of them touches real data:

**Admin UI:** **Observability → Trace** (`/_/admin/diagnostics/trace`). Enter method, path, and whether the request is authenticated; the panel renders the reason path and offers Copy-as-JSON.

**CLI:**

```bash
DGP_BOOTSTRAP_PASSWORD=... deltaglider_proxy admission trace \
  --method PUT --path /downloads/public/tool.zip \
  --server https://s3.acme.example | jq
```

Add `--authenticated` to simulate a signed request, `--query` for query strings. The password comes from the env var, not a flag — argv is visible in `ps`.

**API:** `POST /_/api/admin/config/trace` with a synthetic request body, or the `GET` query-param variant for bookmarkable trace URLs:

```bash
curl -b cookies "https://s3.acme.example/_/api/admin/config/trace?method=PUT&path=/downloads/public/tool.zip"
```

## 3. Read the reason path

The trace output is a decision plus the chain that produced it: the decision tag (allow / allow-anonymous / deny / reject), the **matched block** by name, and the resolved request as the evaluator saw it. Admission is first-match-wins, so the named block is the complete answer — nothing after it was consulted.

Worked example — `downloads` has a public prefix:

```yaml
storage:
  buckets:
    downloads:
      public_prefixes:
        - public/
```

- Trace `GET /downloads/public/tool.zip`, unauthenticated → **allow-anonymous**, matched block `public-prefix:downloads/public/` — the block synthesized from the bucket policy, granting read+list only.
- Trace `PUT /downloads/public/tool.zip`, unauthenticated → **denied**. The public-prefix block matches only read methods, so the PUT falls through to authentication, which an anonymous request fails.

Same prefix, opposite outcomes — and the trace names the exact block responsible for each.

## 4. Turn on debug headers

For per-request visibility on real traffic, set `DGP_DEBUG_HEADERS=true` and read the response headers:

- `x-amz-storage-type` — how the object is stored: `delta`, `passthrough`, or `reference`.
- `x-deltaglider-cache: hit|miss` — on every delta-reconstructed GET; tells you whether the reference baseline came from the cache.

Leave this **off** in production once you're done — it reveals storage internals to anyone who can send a request.

## Verify

```bash
# Trace agrees with reality: this should print an allow-anonymous decision...
DGP_BOOTSTRAP_PASSWORD=... deltaglider_proxy admission trace \
  --method GET --path /downloads/public/tool.zip --server https://s3.acme.example | jq .decision

# ...and the real request behaves the same way
curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}\n" https://s3.acme.example/downloads/public/tool.zip
```

Then make one failing authenticated request on purpose and confirm it appears in the audit log within seconds.
