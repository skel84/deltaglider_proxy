# Event outbox

Durable object events are written to the encrypted config DB after successful S3 mutations. The outbox is append-first: PUT/COPY/DELETE, replication copy successes, and lifecycle delete/transition successes do not call external systems directly, so object operations do not wait on webhook latency or failures.

## Semantics

- Rows are stored in `event_outbox` with status `pending`, `in_progress`, `delivered`, or `failed`.
- Delivery is disabled by default. With no delivery config, the outbox is an operator-visible journal only.
- When HTTP delivery is enabled, a background dispatcher claims due rows in small batches, POSTs each row to every configured webhook endpoint, and marks it delivered only after all endpoints return 2xx.
- Delivery is at-least-once. Webhook receivers must be idempotent, typically by deduplicating on `event.id`.
- Multiple webhooks are fan-out, not independent subscriptions. If one endpoint fails, the row is retried and endpoints that already accepted the event may see it again.
- Failed attempts use exponential backoff. After `max_attempts`, the row becomes permanently `failed` until an operator requeues it.
- Requeue does not create a new event. It changes only `failed` rows back to `pending`, clears claim/error fields, preserves `attempts` as delivery history, and makes the row due immediately.
- Stale `in_progress` claims are reclaimable so a crashed dispatcher does not wedge rows forever.
- Delivered rows are pruned by the dispatcher after `delivered_retention` and capped by `delivered_max_rows`. Pending, in-progress, and failed rows are not deleted by retention pruning because they still need operator or dispatcher action.
- Default healthy-state DB bound is: all non-delivered rows plus at most 10,000 delivered rows. If delivery is broken, pending/failed rows can exceed that until delivery is fixed, rows are requeued, or the DB is cleared.

## YAML grammar

```yaml
advanced:
  event_delivery:
    enabled: true
    webhook_url: "https://events.example.com/deltaglider"
    webhook_urls:
      - "https://audit.example.com/deltaglider"
    webhook_headers:
      authorization: "Bearer redacted-token"
      x-dgp-env: "prod"
    tick_interval: "10s"
    batch_size: 50
    request_timeout: "5s"
    max_attempts: 8
    retry_base: "5s"
    retry_max: "5m"
    stale_claim_after: "60s"
    delivered_retention: "24h"
    delivered_max_rows: 10000
    prune_batch: 100
```

The default is inert: `enabled: false`. `enabled=true` without `webhook_url` or `webhook_urls` is treated as inactive and surfaces a config warning. `webhook_url` is the single-endpoint shortcut; `webhook_urls` adds fan-out endpoints.

## Webhook payload

Event kinds are `ObjectCreated`, `ObjectDeleted`, `ObjectCopied`, `ReplicationObjectCopied`, `LifecycleExpired`, and `LifecycleTransitioned`.

Each POST body is JSON:

```json
{
  "schema": "deltaglider.event.v1",
  "event": {
    "id": 123,
    "kind": "ObjectCreated",
    "bucket": "releases",
    "key": "firmware/widget-3000/fw-2.4.1.tar",
    "source": "s3_api",
    "occurred_at": 1777900000,
    "payload": {},
    "status": "in_progress",
    "attempts": 1,
    "next_attempt_at": null,
    "claimed_by": "event-delivery:...",
    "claimed_at": 1777900005,
    "delivered_at": null,
    "last_error": null,
    "created_at": 1777900000
  }
}
```

## Slack format

`event_delivery.format: slack` delivers Slack messages instead of the raw `{schema,event}` envelope. No OAuth is involved — delivery is outbound HTTPS with a pasted credential, in one of two mutually exclusive modes:

- **Incoming Webhook mode** — `webhook_url` is a `https://hooks.slack.com/services/…` URL. Each URL is bound to one channel by Slack. `slack_username` and `slack_icon_emoji` are optional cosmetic sender overrides.
- **Bot-token mode** — `slack_bot_token` is an `xoxb-…` token (requires the `chat:write` and `chat:write.public` scopes); `slack_channel` (channel id or `#name`) is required and no webhook URL is set.

The bot token is a secret: it is masked to `__redacted__` on export and in the admin GUI, and an unchanged round-trip preserves the real token. The Slack Web API returns HTTP 200 even on failure, so delivery checks the JSON `ok` field and retries on `{"ok": false}` (e.g. `channel_not_found`).

Filtering: `slack_notify_kinds` (default `["ObjectCreated"]`) selects which event kinds post; `slack_include_globs` / `slack_exclude_globs` are a key-glob pre-filter (exclude wins; empty include = all user objects). Directory markers and DeltaGlider internals (`reference.bin`, `*.delta`, `.deltaglider/*`) are never posted. Each message is Block Kit (header + object section + context line with size / storage strategy / timestamp) plus a plain `text` fallback.

Per-bucket / per-prefix channel routing (`slack_routes`) is bot-token-mode-only. An eligible event posts to every route it matches; `slack_channel` is the fallback for events that match no route. The top-level kind/glob filters are a global pre-filter; routes then decide which channels.

```yaml
  slack_routes:
    - name: "Releases → #ci"
      bucket: "releases"
      prefix_globs: ["firmware/**"]   # empty = any key in the bucket
      channel: "C_CI"
    - name: "DB archive → #ops"
      bucket: "db-archive"          # no prefix_globs = the whole bucket
      channel: "C_OPS"
```

The same fields are editable in the admin GUI at **Integrations → Event delivery**, including a live message preview.

## Admin API

All routes are session-gated.

| Method | Path | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `GET` | `/_/api/admin/event-outbox?limit=50&offset=0&sort=occurred_at&order=desc` | Paged outbox rows plus status counts. |
| `GET` | `/_/api/admin/event-outbox?status=failed&limit=50&offset=0` | Paged rows for one status (`pending`, `in_progress`, `delivered`, `failed`). |
| `POST` | `/_/api/admin/event-outbox/:id/requeue` | Requeue one `failed` row. Returns `409` if the row is not currently failed. |
| `POST` | `/_/api/admin/event-outbox/requeue` | Requeue failed rows by id: `{ "ids": [123, 124] }`. Non-failed ids are ignored. |

`limit` defaults to 50 and is clamped to 500. Sort fields are `id`, `occurred_at`, `created_at`, `next_attempt_at`, `delivered_at`, `attempts`, `status`, `kind`, `bucket`, and `key`; `order` is `asc` or `desc`. The list response carries `rows`, per-status `counts`, `total`, the echoed paging/sort parameters, and the `delivery_enabled` / `delivery_active` flags.
