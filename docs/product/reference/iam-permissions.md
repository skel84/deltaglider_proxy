# IAM permissions and conditions

Reference for the ABAC permission model: rule shape, actions, resource patterns, identity templates, condition operators and keys, LIST scoping, and group resolution.

## Permission shape

Each IAM user carries one or more permission rules, evaluated per request after SigV4 verification:

```json
{
  "effect": "Allow",
  "actions": ["read", "write", "list"],
  "resources": ["releases/firmware/*"],
  "conditions": {
    "IpAddress": { "aws:SourceIp": "203.0.113.0/24" }
  }
}
```

`effect`, `actions`, and `resources` are required; `conditions` is optional.

### Effect

| Value | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `Allow` | Grants access when actions, resources, and conditions all match |
| `Deny` | Blocks access when it matches — overrides every Allow, whether the Deny comes from the user's direct rules or an inherited group |

A request with no matching Allow is implicitly denied.

### Actions

| Action | S3 operations |
|--------|---------------|
| `read` | GetObject, HeadObject |
| `write` | PutObject, CopyObject, CreateMultipartUpload, UploadPart, CompleteMultipartUpload |
| `delete` | DeleteObject, DeleteObjects |
| `list` | ListBuckets, ListObjectsV2, ListMultipartUploads, ListParts |
| `admin` | CreateBucket, DeleteBucket |
| `*` | All actions |

A user is an **admin** (admin GUI access, config changes) when at least one Allow rule has actions containing `*` or `admin` AND resources containing `*`.

### Resources

Glob patterns matched against `bucket/key`:

| Pattern | Matches |
|---------|---------|
| `*` | Every bucket and key |
| `releases` | Bucket-level operations only (list, create) |
| `releases/*` | Every object in `releases` |
| `releases/firmware/*` | Objects under the `firmware/` prefix |
| `releases/firmware/fw-2.*` | Glob on the object key |

Bucket-level operations match the bare bucket name (no `/*`); object operations match `bucket/*`. Full access to one bucket therefore requires both rules:

```json
[
  { "effect": "Allow", "actions": ["*"], "resources": ["releases"] },
  { "effect": "Allow", "actions": ["*"], "resources": ["releases/*"] }
]
```

## Permission templates

Resource strings and string condition values accept identity templates:

| Template | Expands to |
|----------|------------|
| `${iam:username}` | The authenticated user's `name` |
| `${iam:access_key_id}` | The authenticated user's access key ID |

Template facts:

- The `iam:` prefix is mandatory; a bare `${username}` is **not** substituted. The prefix distinguishes request-time identity substitution from the `${env:NAME}` load-time config expansion. A stale bare `${username}` leaves a literal, unmatchable resource pattern — so the rule matches nothing and the user is **silently denied**. The save-time config advisories flag this; see [Config advisories](configuration.md#config-advisories).
- Templates are stored raw in the DB/YAML and expanded when the in-memory IAM index is built, after group permissions are merged into each member user.
- Identity values are percent-encoded before substitution: a username `dana/team*` becomes `dana%2Fteam%2A`, so it cannot inject path separators or wildcards.
- Unknown templates are rejected by user/group API validation and by declarative IAM apply.

Example — a per-user home prefix in `db-archive`, shared via the `Engineering` group:

```json
{
  "effect": "Allow",
  "actions": ["read", "write", "list"],
  "resources": ["db-archive/home/${iam:username}/*"]
}
```

For `dana` this expands to `db-archive/home/dana/*`.

## Conditions

Conditions within a single rule are ANDed — all must match for the rule to apply. Multiple values for the same key are ORed.

### Condition operators

| Operator | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `StringEquals` | Exact string match | `s3:prefix` = `"firmware/"` |
| `StringNotEquals` | Exact string non-match | `s3:prefix` != `"internal/"` |
| `StringLike` | Glob pattern match | `s3:prefix` LIKE `"home/dana/*"` |
| `StringNotLike` | Glob pattern non-match | `s3:prefix` NOT LIKE `".*"` |
| `IpAddress` | CIDR range match | `aws:SourceIp` in `203.0.113.0/24` |
| `NotIpAddress` | CIDR range non-match | `aws:SourceIp` NOT in `203.0.113.0/24` |

### Condition keys

| Key | Type | Available on | Value |
|-----|------|--------------|-------|
| `aws:SourceIp` | IP address (CIDR) | All requests | Client IP — from the direct connection, or from `X-Forwarded-For` / `X-Real-IP` when `DGP_TRUST_PROXY_HEADERS=true` |
| `s3:prefix` | String | LIST requests | The `prefix` query parameter |

With `DGP_TRUST_PROXY_HEADERS=true` on a proxy exposed directly to the internet, clients can spoof `aws:SourceIp` via a forged `X-Forwarded-For` header.

`s3:prefix` string values accept the identity templates above, with the same storage, expansion, and percent-encoding rules as resource patterns.

### JSON format

```json
{
  "IpAddress": {
    "aws:SourceIp": ["203.0.113.0/24"]
  },
  "StringNotLike": {
    "s3:prefix": "internal/*"
  }
}
```

## ListBucket prefix scoping

When a user with prefix-scoped permissions (for example `{ "resources": ["db-archive/home/dana/*"] }`) issues a LIST with an empty prefix, or a prefix wider than the policy covers, the proxy admits the request and post-filters the result:

- Each returned key and CommonPrefix is checked against the user's policy; only keys with `read` or `list` permission are returned.
- Filtered pages carry the response header `x-amz-meta-dg-list-filtered: true`.
- `is_truncated` and the continuation token reflect the engine-level cursor, not the filtered count; the client's `max_keys` acts as a server-side inspection cap, so a returned page may be smaller than requested.
- Users whose policy covers the full requested scope receive the engine page unchanged, with no filtering cost.

## Workflow-bypass prevention

A PUT to a non-existent bucket returns `404 NoSuchBucket` on every backend — including the filesystem backend, where the underlying FS could create the parent directory. Bucket creation requires the `admin` action; it cannot occur as a side effect of a write.

## Canned policy templates

The admin GUI (**Access → Users → Apply template**) offers four starting-point policies. Generated permissions are editable before saving.

| Template | Permissions |
|----------|-------------|
| Read-only | `read`, `list` on every resource |
| Developer | `read`, `write`, `list` on every resource |
| Admin | All actions on every resource |
| Bucket owner | All actions on one named bucket (selected on apply) |

## Group resolution

- A user's effective permissions are the union of their direct rules and the rules of every group they belong to (for example, `dana`'s direct rules plus the `Engineering` group's rules).
- Group permissions are merged into each member at IAM index build time; identity templates expand after this merge.
- Deny precedence applies across the union: a Deny in any source — direct or inherited — overrides Allows from all sources.
- OAuth group mapping rules add group memberships on each login; memberships are merged, never replaced, so manual assignments persist.
- The built-in Administrators group carries `{ "effect": "Allow", "actions": ["*"], "resources": ["*"] }`.
