# Authentication and access

DeltaGlider Proxy supports multiple authentication methods: **SigV4** (standard S3 auth), **OAuth/OIDC** (Google, Okta, Azure AD), and **public prefixes** (anonymous read access). These can be combined — OAuth users get IAM permissions via group mapping, while specific folders are optionally published for unauthenticated download.

## Auth Modes

### Bootstrap Mode (default on fresh install)

A single S3 credential pair configured via YAML or environment variables. All clients share the same credentials. Admin GUI access requires the **bootstrap password**.

```yaml
# deltaglider_proxy.yaml
access:
  access_key_id: myaccesskey
  secret_access_key: mysecretkey
```

```bash
export DGP_ACCESS_KEY_ID=myaccesskey
export DGP_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=mysecretkey
```

### IAM Mode (activates when IAM users exist)

Per-user credentials stored in an encrypted SQLCipher database (`deltaglider_config.db`). Each user has their own access key, secret key, and permission rules. Admin GUI access is permission-based — IAM admins don't need the bootstrap password.

IAM mode activates automatically when the first IAM user is created via the admin GUI or via OAuth auto-provisioning. The bootstrap credentials are migrated as a "legacy-admin" user.

### IAM Source of Truth (`access.iam_mode`)

Orthogonal to the bootstrap/IAM/OAuth selection above, the `access.iam_mode` YAML selector controls **where IAM state lives**:

- `gui` *(default)* — the encrypted SQLCipher DB is authoritative. Admin GUI + admin API mutate the DB directly. YAML `access:` carries only the legacy SigV4 pair + `authentication` selector.
- `declarative` — YAML is authoritative. Admin API IAM mutation routes (`POST/PUT/PATCH/DELETE` on `/users`, `/groups`, `/ext-auth/*`, `/migrate`, backup import) return `403 { "error": "iam_declarative" }`. Read routes stay accessible.

```yaml
access:
  iam_mode: declarative
```

Mode transitions are audit-logged at `warn` level on the `deltaglider_proxy::config` target.

In declarative mode, `access.iam_users`, `access.iam_groups`, `access.auth_providers`, and `access.group_mapping_rules` in the YAML ARE authoritative. The reconciler runs on every `/config/apply` (or section-PUT on `access`), diffs YAML against the encrypted DB, and applies creates/updates/deletes atomically in a single transaction. User/group IDs are preserved across updates so OAuth `external_identities` stay valid through access-key rotations. See [`declarative-iam.md`](declarative-iam.md) for the wire shape, adversarial edges, and the two setup workflows (export-from-DB vs author-from-scratch).

### OAuth/OIDC Mode

Users authenticate via an external identity provider (Google, Okta, Azure AD, Keycloak, or any OIDC-compliant provider). The proxy handles the full OAuth flow: PKCE, state parameter, nonce, and JWT validation.

On first login, the proxy **auto-provisions** an IAM user from the identity provider's claims (email, name, subject). On subsequent logins, the existing user is updated with fresh identity data.

**Group mapping rules** automatically assign permissions based on:
- **Email domain** — `*@company.com` matches all company employees
- **Email glob** — `admin-*@company.com` matches admin accounts
- **Email regex** — full regex pattern matching
- **Claim value** — match on any JWT claim (department, role, etc.)

Configured via the admin GUI under **Access → External authentication → Mapping Rules** (in `iam_mode: gui`) or via `access.auth_providers` + `access.group_mapping_rules` in YAML (in `iam_mode: declarative` — see [`declarative-iam.md`](declarative-iam.md)).

### Public Prefixes (anonymous read access)

Specific bucket/prefix paths can be configured for unauthenticated read-only access. Anonymous users can GET, HEAD, and LIST objects under public prefixes — but cannot PUT, DELETE, or access anything outside the configured prefixes.

```yaml
storage:
  buckets:
    releases:
      public_prefixes: ["builds/", "artifacts/"]
    docs-site:
      public: true        # shorthand for public_prefixes: [""]
```

See [Public Prefixes](#public-prefixes) below for details.

### Operator-Authored Admission Blocks

Pre-auth request gating is authored in `admission.blocks[]`. Blocks are evaluated top-to-bottom and fire before the synthesized public-prefix blocks derived from `storage.buckets[*].public_prefixes`.

```yaml
admission:
  blocks:
    - name: deny-known-bad-ips
      match:
        source_ip_list: ["203.0.113.5", "198.51.100.0/24"]
      action: deny
    - name: maintenance-mode
      match: {}
      action:
        type: reject
        status: 503
        message: "We'll be right back."
```

See [configuration.md](configuration.md#admission-chain) for the full operator wire format.

### Open Access (development only)

The proxy **refuses to start** without authentication credentials. To explicitly run without authentication:

```yaml
access:
  authentication: none
```

> **Security**: Open access exposes all S3 data without credentials. Never use in production.

## Bootstrap Password

A single infrastructure secret that serves three purposes:

1. **Encrypts the config database** — IAM users, OAuth providers, and group mapping rules are stored in SQLCipher, encrypted with the bcrypt hash of this password
2. **Signs admin session cookies** — HMAC-based session authentication for the admin GUI
3. **Gates admin GUI access** — In bootstrap mode (before IAM users exist), this password is required to access settings

### Lifecycle

- **Auto-generated** on first run if not set. The plaintext is printed to stderr only when stderr is a TTY; in containers/CI only the bcrypt hash is logged. Hash saved to `.deltaglider_bootstrap_hash`.
- **Set explicitly** via `DGP_BOOTSTRAP_PASSWORD_HASH` env var (accepts bcrypt or base64-encoded bcrypt — base64 avoids `$` escaping in Docker/shell). YAML: `advanced.bootstrap_password_hash`. Legacy alias: `DGP_ADMIN_PASSWORD_HASH`.
- **Reset** via `--set-bootstrap-password` CLI flag (reads the new plaintext from stdin).

> **Warning**: Resetting the bootstrap password invalidates the encrypted IAM database. All IAM users, OAuth providers, and group mappings will be lost. The proper rotation path is `PUT /_/api/admin/password` (verifies the current password and re-encrypts the DB atomically).

## IAM Permissions (ABAC)

![IAM user management with ABAC permissions](/_/screenshots/iam.jpg)

Each IAM user (whether created manually or auto-provisioned via OAuth) has one or more permission rules:

```json
{
  "effect": "Allow",
  "actions": ["read", "list"],
  "resources": ["mybucket/releases/*"],
  "conditions": {
    "IpAddress": { "aws:SourceIp": "10.0.0.0/8" }
  }
}
```

### Actions

| Action | S3 Operations |
|--------|---------------|
| `read` | GetObject, HeadObject |
| `write` | PutObject, CopyObject, CreateMultipartUpload, UploadPart, CompleteMultipartUpload |
| `delete` | DeleteObject, DeleteObjects |
| `list` | ListBuckets, ListObjectsV2, ListMultipartUploads, ListParts |
| `admin` | Admin GUI access, config changes |
| `*` | All actions |

### Resources

Glob patterns matching `bucket/key`:
- `*` — all buckets and keys (full admin)
- `mybucket/*` — all keys in `mybucket`
- `mybucket/releases/*` — keys under `releases/` prefix

### Effect

- `Allow` — grants access (default)
- `Deny` — explicitly blocks access (overrides Allow rules)

### Conditions (optional)

AWS IAM-style condition blocks:
- `aws:SourceIp` — restrict by client IP (CIDR notation)
- `s3:prefix` — restrict LIST operations to specific prefixes

See [IAM conditions](../auth/32-iam-conditions.md) for full reference.

A user is considered an **admin** when they have both wildcard actions (`*`) AND wildcard resources (`*`).

### ListBucket scope filtering

When a user with **prefix-scoped** permissions (e.g. `{ resources: ["bucket/alice/*"] }`) calls `GET /bucket?list-type=2&prefix=` with an empty prefix or a prefix wider than their policy covers, the proxy admits the request (so the user can discover their own keys) but **post-filters each returned key and CommonPrefix** through their per-key policy. Only keys the user has `read` OR `list` permission on are returned.

Operators and SDKs can tell a filtered page from an unrestricted one via the `x-amz-meta-dg-list-filtered: true` response header.

Pagination stays honest: `is_truncated` and the continuation token reflect the engine-level cursor (not the filtered count). The client's `max_keys` acts as a server-side inspection cap — the returned page may be smaller. This matches AWS's documented behaviour when denies apply within allows.

**Unscoped users pay no filter cost** — if the policy covers the full bucket/prefix, the handler returns the engine page unchanged.

### Workflow bypass prevention

The proxy refuses to implicitly create a bucket as a side effect of a PUT. Even on the filesystem backend (where the underlying FS would happily create a parent directory), writes to a non-existent bucket return `404 NoSuchBucket` — matching the S3 backend's contract and preventing bypass of bucket-creation authorization.

## IAM Groups

Users can be organized into **groups** with shared permission rules. Group permissions are merged with the user's direct permissions at evaluation time.

Groups are managed via the admin GUI (**Admin Settings > Groups**). OAuth group mapping rules automatically add users to groups on login.

## OAuth/OIDC Configuration

![OAuth login with Google SSO](/_/screenshots/oauth_login.jpg)

### Setting Up a Provider

1. Open the admin GUI → **Admin Settings** → **Authentication**
2. Click **Add Provider** and select the provider type (Google, OIDC Generic)
3. Enter the required fields:
   - **Client ID** — from your identity provider's OAuth app
   - **Client Secret** — from your identity provider's OAuth app
   - **Issuer URL** — OIDC discovery endpoint (e.g. `https://accounts.google.com`)
   - **Display Name** — shown on the login button
4. Save and test

### Group Mapping Rules

![OAuth group mapping rules](/_/screenshots/oauth_group_mapping.jpg)

After configuring an OAuth provider, set up mapping rules to auto-assign permissions:

1. Go to **Authentication** → **Mapping Rules**
2. Add a rule:
   - **Match type**: email_domain, email_glob, email_regex, or claim_value
   - **Match value**: the pattern to match (e.g. `company.com`, `admin-*@company.com`)
   - **Target group**: which IAM group to add matched users to
3. Save

On each OAuth login, the user's group memberships are **merged** (not replaced) — existing group memberships from previous logins or manual assignment are preserved.

### OAuth Login Flow

```
Browser → /_/ login page → "Sign in with Google" button
    → Redirect to Google (PKCE + state + nonce)
    → User authenticates with Google
    → Google redirects back to /_/api/admin/oauth/callback
    → Proxy validates JWT (algorithm from header, audience, issuer, nonce)
    → Auto-provision or update IAM user
    → Apply group mapping rules
    → Create admin session + auto-populate S3 credentials
    → Redirect to /_/browse
```

## Public Prefixes

Public prefixes allow unauthenticated read-only access to specific bucket/prefix paths. Useful for publishing release artifacts, documentation, or public assets.

### Configuration

```yaml
storage:
  buckets:
    releases:
      public_prefixes: ["builds/", "docs/"]
    docs-site:
      public: true        # entire bucket — shorthand
```

Or via the admin GUI → **Storage → Buckets** → edit bucket → **Anonymous read access** (tri-state: None / Specific prefixes / Entire bucket).

### Behavior

- **Allowed without auth**: GET, HEAD on objects under the prefix; LIST with a matching prefix
- **Always denied without auth**: PUT, DELETE, COPY, multipart uploads
- **Scoped**: anonymous LIST only returns objects under the public prefix — not the whole bucket
- **Auth still wins**: if a request carries valid SigV4 credentials, full IAM evaluation runs regardless of public prefix config
- **Audit logged**: all anonymous access is logged as `user=$anonymous`

### Security Notes

- Trailing `/` on prefixes is significant: `builds/` only matches `builds/...`, not `buildscripts/`
- Empty prefix `""` makes the **entire bucket** public (logged as a warning at startup)
- Prefixes containing `..`, null bytes, or `//` are rejected

## SigV4 Verification

The proxy verifies SigV4 signatures from two sources:

| Path | Source | Use case |
|------|--------|----------|
| **Header auth** | `Authorization: AWS4-HMAC-SHA256 ...` | Standard S3 SDK calls |
| **Presigned URL** | `X-Amz-Algorithm` + `X-Amz-Signature` query params | Browser downloads, shareable links (up to 7 days) |

Both paths extract the access key ID, look up the user (bootstrap: single credential; IAM: lookup by access key), and verify the HMAC-SHA256 signature against the user's secret key using constant-time comparison.

### Verify-Then-Re-sign

SigV4 signatures are bound to the Host header and URI path. The proxy cannot forward the client's signature — it verifies it, discards it, and makes its own authenticated requests to the backend using the AWS SDK.

## S3 Backend Credentials

When using the S3 backend, the proxy needs two credential sets:

1. **Proxy credentials** — for client-to-proxy auth (SigV4 or OAuth)
2. **Backend credentials** — for proxy-to-upstream-S3 auth

```bash
# Backend auth (proxy → upstream S3/MinIO)
export DGP_BE_AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=minioadmin
export DGP_BE_AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=minioadmin
export DGP_S3_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:9000
```

## Using with S3 Tools

### aws-cli

```bash
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=myaccesskey
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=mysecretkey
export AWS_ENDPOINT_URL=http://localhost:9000

aws s3 cp file.zip s3://mybucket/file.zip
aws s3 ls s3://mybucket/
aws s3 presign s3://mybucket/file.zip --expires-in 3600
```

### boto3 (Python)

```python
import boto3

s3 = boto3.client(
    's3',
    endpoint_url='http://localhost:9000',
    aws_access_key_id='myaccesskey',
    aws_secret_access_key='mysecretkey',
    region_name='us-east-1',
)

s3.upload_file('file.zip', 'mybucket', 'file.zip')
url = s3.generate_presigned_url(
    'get_object',
    Params={'Bucket': 'mybucket', 'Key': 'file.zip'},
    ExpiresIn=3600,
)
```

## Error Responses

| Error Code | HTTP Status | Cause |
|---|---|---|
| `AccessDenied` | 403 | Missing credentials, insufficient permissions, or public prefix mismatch |
| `SignatureDoesNotMatch` | 403 | Signature verification failed |
| `RequestTimeTooSkewed` | 403 | Client clock differs from server by more than the configured tolerance |
| `InvalidArgument` | 400 | Malformed Authorization header or unparseable date/expiry |
| `SlowDown` | 429 | Rate limited due to repeated auth failures |

All errors are returned as standard S3 XML error responses.

## Security Considerations

- **Use HTTPS in production**: SigV4 authenticates but does not encrypt. Use a TLS-terminating reverse proxy or enable built-in TLS.
- **Bootstrap password security**: The bootstrap password encrypts the IAM database. Treat it like a master key.
- **Credential rotation**: IAM user keys can be rotated via the admin GUI without downtime.
- **Presigned URL expiration**: Maximum 7 days. Generate short-lived URLs when possible.
- **OAuth session hardening**: Sessions are IP-bound, have configurable TTL (default 4h), and auto-evict oldest when the concurrent session limit (10) is reached.
- **Region**: The proxy accepts any region in the credential scope. Standard S3 tools default to `us-east-1`.
