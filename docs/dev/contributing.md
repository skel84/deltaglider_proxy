# Contributing

*Build, test, project structure*

Thanks for your interest in contributing! Whether it's a bug report, feature idea, or code change, we appreciate your help.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Rust stable** — install via [rustup](https://rustup.rs/) (the repo's `rust-toolchain.toml` pins the channel automatically)
- **Node.js 20+** — needed to build the embedded demo UI
- **Docker** — optional, used for running MinIO in integration tests

### Building from Source

```bash
# 1. Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/beshu-tech/deltaglider_proxy.git
cd deltaglider_proxy

# 2. Build the demo UI (rust-embed bakes it into the binary)
cd demo/s3-browser/ui && npm install && npm run build && cd -

# 3. Build the proxy
cargo build

# 4. Run it
DGP_DATA_DIR=./data cargo run
```

The S3 API and demo UI both start on `http://localhost:9000`. The UI is available at `http://localhost:9000/_/`.

### Running Tests

```bash
# Unit tests (no MinIO)
cargo test --lib --locked

# One integration binary (many need MinIO on localhost:9000 — see tests/common/mod.rs)
cargo test --locked --test s3_integration_test

# Full matrix (run before a release or after changing shared test harness / CI lists)
cargo test --all --locked
```

PR CI does **not** run `cargo test --all` (wall-clock); it runs `cargo test --lib` plus **explicit** integration binaries listed in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`. Every `tests/<name>.rs` must appear there — `./scripts/check-integration-tests-in-ci.sh` enforces it. A **nightly** workflow (`test-all-nightly.yml`) runs `cargo test --all` with MinIO.

### Code Quality Checks

The merge gate matches `.github/workflows/ci.yml` — run these before submitting a PR:

```bash
cargo fmt --all -- --check
cargo clippy --locked --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings
cargo test --lib --locked
./scripts/check-integration-tests-in-ci.sh
cd demo/s3-browser/ui && npm ci && npm run build && npm run lint && npm run typecheck && npm run knip \
  && npm run test:permissions && npm run test:storage-path
# Optional local parity with CI integration batches (needs MinIO):
cargo test --locked --test s3_integration_test
```

Embedded UI smoke (Playwright — same as `e2e-smoke` CI job): from repo root, `cargo build --release --bin deltaglider_proxy` with UI already built, then `cd demo/s3-browser/ui && npx playwright install chromium && cd ../../../.. && ./scripts/e2e-smoke.sh`.

### Key Concepts

- **DeltaSpace**: A group of objects under the same directory prefix that share a single baseline for delta compression. For example, all objects under `releases/` form one deltaspace.
- **Reference file**: The internal baseline stored once per deltaspace. All deltas are computed against it (no chaining), so reconstruction is always O(1).
- **StorageBackend**: A trait abstracting where bytes live — local filesystem or upstream S3. Adding a new backend means implementing this trait.
- **File router**: Decides whether a file is delta-eligible based on its extension (`.zip`, `.jar`, `.tar`, etc.) or should be stored as passthrough (`.jpg`, `.mp4`, etc.).

## Admin-UI patterns (frontend)

The admin GUI (`demo/s3-browser/ui`) has converged on a small set of canonical
patterns. New panels and edits should follow these rather than re-inventing —
divergence here has historically produced a recurring "admin-editor bug class"
(stale closures, array-index keys, double sources of truth).

**Two data families, two pipelines.**
- **Config sections** (`admission` / `access` / `storage` / `advanced`) → the
  **`useSectionEditor`** hook. It owns fetch → dirty-tracking → validate →
  `ApplyDialog` → section-PUT → re-fetch, with `pick` (wire→form) / `toPayload`
  (form→wire) hooks. The editor `value` IS the single source of truth — never
  keep a parallel state mirror of it. Examples: Admission, Credentials, all
  Advanced sub-panels, Webhook delivery, Replication, Lifecycle, Buckets.
- **IAM DB resources** (users / groups / OAuth providers / mapping rules) →
  **react-query** (`queries/`, keyed by `qk.*`) for reads + per-record mutations.
  Read the cached admin config with `useAdminConfig()` — do NOT hand-roll
  `useEffect(getAdminConfig().then(setState))`. After a config mutation,
  invalidate `qk.config()` (the section editor already does this on apply).

**Single source of truth for forms.** A form's React state should be the only
copy of its editable data. For master-detail forms (User/Group/etc.), initialize
state from the selected record with **lazy `useState(() => ...)` initializers +
a `key` on the form** (`key={record.id}` for edit, `key="new"` for create) so a
keyed remount resets state — never a `useEffect([record])` prop→state mirror.

**Stable row ids, never array index.** Row-list editors (endpoints, headers,
glob rows, routes, permissions, rules) key React lists by a stable id (a
per-instance `nextId()` counter or the record's own id), and mutate rows by id
(`rows.map(r => r.id === id ? {...} : r)`), never by index.

**Pure helpers + Node regression tests.** Validation, payload-building, and
normalization live in pure functions (e.g. `webhookDeliveryPayload.ts`'s
`formFromWire` / `buildPayloadFromForm`), not inline in components, and get a
`scripts/*-regression-test.mjs` Node test (registered in `package.json` + CI).
Mirrors the Rust convention of pure decision-fns at seams (`classify_*`,
`validate_*`, `resolve_*`) with colocated unit tests.

**Secret round-trip.** Secret fields (webhook headers, Slack bot token, SigV4)
are masked to the `REDACTED_SENTINEL` (`__redacted__`) on GET; the UI shows a
"•••• (unchanged — type to replace)" placeholder and, on save, passes the
sentinel through untouched so the backend preserves the real value — on BOTH the
section-PUT and document export→apply paths. Removed map entries emit an explicit
`null` (RFC 7396 delete).

**Shared visual primitives** (reuse, don't re-style): `useCardStyles` /
`SectionHeader` (cards), `FormField` (label + YAML-path breadcrumb + helpText +
example chips — wrap every field; help should always be present), `StickyDirtyBar`
(the slim floating unsaved-changes bar — use `floating` when it can't be the last
child in the scroll flow), `ApplyDialog` (plan → diff → apply). Every editable
field should have a `helpText` and a `placeholder`/example.
